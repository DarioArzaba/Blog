![Lucia Cover](/static/images/movies/lucia.jpg)

* Lucia (2013) is a psychological thriller film, in hindu Kannada, written and directed by Pawan Kumar.
* The project was funded through crowdfunding, starring Satish Neenasam and Sruthi Hariharan.
* A man suffering from insomnia buys a drug called Lucia that makes his wishes come true inside his dreams.

The concept of the lucid dream and probably the origin of the title is a very interesting science fiction concept, the movie raises many philosophical questions about what reality means.

**Pros**

* Original story, interesting use of effects, good cinematography and acting. 
* It definitely reminds me of Inception and Beyond Dreams.
* Visually experiencing the amalgamation of dreams and reality elicits feelings of wonder.
* It makes a precedent for good crowdfunded movies.

**Cons**

* Very abstract, the meaning of things can be hard to decipher.
* Its low budget production can break the immersion.

**Verdict**

* Good movie. 
* First watch is a maybe just because of the original plot. 
* I would not watch it again in a long time.
