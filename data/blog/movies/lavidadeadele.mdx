* Blue Is the Warmest Color (2013) is a drama and romance film directed by the Tunisian director Abdellatif Kechiche.
* An adaptation of the 2010 graphic novel of the same name, starring Léa Seydoux and Adèle Exarchopoulos.
* The movie manages to capture the difficulties that arise when giving meaning to our relationships, emotions and sexuality.

In the romance genre it is a surprise to come across a film that expresses so sincerely what it means to fall in love, and moreover it achieves it even if both our protagonists are deeply flawed. The theme of homosexuality is present throughout the film but its implications are just part of the relationship, this manages to emphasize that love is universal, to every human being, and it doesn't depend on their sexual orientation.

***

**Pros**

* It portrays some of the most raw and realistic depictions of love.
* It reminds me of *500 days with her* but with vastly different characters.
* Great acting, good cinematography and great dialogue that can be funny at times.

**Cons**

* Graphic sex scenes warning.
* So hyper focused on their relationship that at times it feels a little bit claustrophobic.

**Verdict**

* Great movie. 
* First watch is a must. 
* I might even watch it again someday.
