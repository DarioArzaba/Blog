* American painter that contributed to the abstract expressionist movement (1912 - 1956).
* Inventor of the *Drip Painting* style of painting. 
* Volatile and emotionally unstable, Pollock had to deal throughout his life with his growing world fame and his alcoholism. 
* The abstract movement of his generation and Pablo Picasso inspired him to leave school and dedicate his life to art.
* Peggy Guggenheim upon learning about Pollock would offer to fully sponsor his art and soon he would be on the cover of LIFE.
* His next and most serious benefactor would be Betty Parson. By 1949 all of Pollock's works in Betty's gallery were sold.
* Overnight Pollock had become America's highest paid abstract painter, however the fame and fortune aggravated his alcoholism.
* Pollock's paintings became opaque and he began labeling them with numbers and dates, he was deeply depressed. 
* After his fame exploded again with *The Deep* his alcoholism returned to claim his life at age 44 in a car accident.
