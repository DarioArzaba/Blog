* Prodigy child, with a life marked by constant social and professional successes.
* He became a friend and personal painter of Queen Victoria, collaborated with Frederick Richard Lee.
* His skills representing animals marveled the public of the Victorian era, but sometimes they where seen too human like.

* Although he was not an expert in sculptures he was commissioned to create the bronze lions in the Nelson column of Trafalgar Square.
* He finished the lions in 1867 after a health decline, followed by dementia, depression and drug addiction.

* His paintings can be found in Tate Britain, Victoria and Albert Museum, Kenwood House and the Wallace Collection.
