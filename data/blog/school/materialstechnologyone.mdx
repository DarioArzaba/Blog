	* A nanometer is a billionth of a meter.
	* When we observe and construct at this scale materials beheave differently.
	* Meddieval artisans processed glass particules to create stained glass colors.
	* Microscopes allow us to see the microstructures we create.
	* Used to create faster computers, tiny medical devices and new kinds of filters.
	* Silicon at diferent sizes has different colors because of quantum confinment.
	* The smaller the crystal volume the higher the kinetic energy of the electrons.
	* Microstructures can have high surface area and low volume making them better filters.
	* Nature creates microstructures in living things using protein assemblies.
	* Currently investigating how to imitate photosintesis on polymers instead of silicon.
	* Researching the dangers caused from the interaction of living cells and nanoparticles.
* [Importance of Material Education (GRANTA)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d30nUOswHw)
	* Materials drive human progress, ages are named after the most usefull material.
	* Stone, bronze, iron, glass, steel, aluminum and plastic have defined human history.
	* Our available material selection chart has expanded and filled with new materials.
	* In 1900 an engineer had hundreds of options, today we have tens of thousands.
	* For example alloys used in jet engines or plastics for mass production.
	* Increase in material availability has also led to resource consumtion and pollution.
	* Material education is vital to create great products but also do it in a responsible way.
