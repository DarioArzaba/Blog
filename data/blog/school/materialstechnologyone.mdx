# Materials Introduction #

Materials technology is an interdisciplinary field of science and engineering that studies the composition and structure of materials to take advantage of its properties in its processing. The science is the research that defines the internal structure, properties and process of the materials. The engineering is the application of the gathered knowledge when creating or modifying products. The objective of materials technology is to evaluate and characterize materials, determine their possible applications, get a better performance, decrease costs and discover new materials. It also focuses on dematerialization (DEMAT) and Green Engineering meaning that it tries to design processes that minimize pollution, promote sustainability and protect human health without sacrificing economic viability or efficiency.
