# Materials Introduction #

Materials technology is an interdisciplinary field of science and engineering that studies the composition and structure of materials to take advantage of its properties in its processing. The science is the research that defines the internal structure, properties and process of the materials. The engineering is the application of the gathered knowledge when creating or modifying products. The objective of materials technology is to evaluate and characterize materials, determine their possible applications, get a better performance, decrease costs and discover new materials. It also focuses on dematerialization (DEMAT) and Green Engineering meaning that it tries to design processes that minimize pollution, promote sustainability and protect human health without sacrificing economic viability or efficiency.

1:00 Chemical links

Classification of material (graphic)

7:00 Atomo structure

Atomic number and Valencia
Number of protons in the nuccle
VALENCIA Number of electrons that participates in the Linkage or in chemical reactions

13:00 Primary links

Primary links
Generate merger points between 1000 and 4000 K

Simple covalent link
Link in which two electrons are shared by two atoms.
H + H = H2
Double covalent link; 4 electrons are shared by two atosm
CH2 + CH2 = C2H4
Link covalent tripe:
CH + CH = C2H2
The most important thing about covalent links is that they are very strong (diamond or silicon carbide) and above all their hardness
They oppose the cuts with greater energy.

Link energy: Minimum energy required to break a chemical link
The link energy between c and h is 413 kj per mol

Ionic link
An ion is an atom or group of atoms with a positive or negative net load.
Li + F = LIF
The cation is the atom that stays with positive charge that is to say that its eletctron
The anion is the atom that is left with negative charge that is to say the one that accepts additional electrons
The opposite load ions are attracting each other and produce ionic links (salt)
It is an electrostatic force

Metal link
The metal elements have electropositive atoms that donate their electrons from Valencia
To form a sea of ​​electrons that surround atoms.
The central parties of atoms with positive load are linked by means of positive mutual attraction electrostatic.
The electrons of Valencia are not fixed in a single porpointing position:
* Good electricity conductors
* Ductility (non-address metal links)
* Experience corocion or oxidation
* Heat conductors

Ceramics and metals are united only by primary links
These strong and rigid links give rise to high modules for example Young module

36:00 Secondary links

Secondary links
100K Fusion Temperatures and 500K
They are the links that bind to polymer molecules such as PE (Polester)

Van der Waals Interactions (Interactions No Links)
London forces: Interactions between two induced dipoles
Debye Interactions: Interaction between an induced dipole and a molecule with a dipolar moment permanently
Keesom interactions: interaction between molecules that are permanently polarized (hydrogen bridges) (water molecule)

45:00 Atomic arrangements
Image of a metal and a ceramic

Solidification
Requires two steps nucleation step and growth step
Particles are going to solidify and it is liquid with small solid particles.
As it cools, the solid particles gather into grains.
Finally the space between them is reduced to a minimum when it solidifies.

Arrangements without order (Argon, water)
Short-range arrangements (Silicon, oxygen, polymers)
Long range arrangements (metals, ceramic)

Material classification based on atomic order

Monoatomic Gases: No order as Argon gas
Amorphous materials: No long-range order oomo Si Amorphous, Glasses, plastics
Liquid crystals: Short-range or long-range order in low volume as LCD polymers
Crystalline Materials: Short and Long Range
Single crystal: Yes, GaAs
Polycristalline: Metals, Alloys, and Ceramics

Short range order:
A material has this order if the arrangement of the atoms only extends to the nearest neighboring atoms-
There is no periodicity in its arrangement.
There is no special arrangement, it has a tetrahedral structure.
For example Silica, Steam water, Polyethylene.

Long range order:
Special atomic arrangement that extends over scales greater than 100nm
For example iron Fe

Crystal Materials:
Atomic or ionic materials with a regular grid-like pattern
Silicon Single Crystal (Microprocessor Wafers)

Polysitaline material:
Made up of several smaller crystals with different orientations, the crystals are known as grains and are separated by grain boundaries (where the crystals are in misalignment).
Stainless Steel (Polycrystalline)

1:11:00 Last concepts

Crystallography: Formal study of atomic arrangements in solids.
Crystal structure: The arrangement of atoms in a material in a regular repeatable lattice

Unitary cell: A simple repeating unit that, when duplicated and transferred, reproduces the entire crystalline structure.
Crystalline systems: Set of the geometric shapes of the unit cells that define the materials.
