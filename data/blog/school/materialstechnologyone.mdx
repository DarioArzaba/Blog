# Materials Introduction #

Materials technology is an interdisciplinary field of science and engineering that studies the composition and structure of materials to take advantage of its properties in its processing. The science is the research that defines the internal structure, properties and process of the materials. The engineering is the application of the gathered knowledge when creating or modifying products. 

The objective of materials technology is to evaluate and characterize materials, determine their possible applications, get a better performance, decrease costs and discover new materials. It also focuses on dematerialization (DEMAT) and Green Engineering meaning that it tries to design processes that minimize pollution, promote sustainability and protect human health without sacrificing viability or efficiency.

# Mechanical Properties #

In engineering, the mechanical properties of the materials are the inherent characteristics that differentiate one from another. When selecting a material one must consider the expected and unexpected loads it might suffer while on duty. When selecting a material we need to know how strong, rigid, ductile it needs to be and the sudden forces, cyclical forces and constant efforts it might be subjected to.

The main objective is to prevent failures such as deformation or fracture. To achieve this goal we must know a material mechanical properties while on their expected use conditions. Examples of mechanical properties under loads are: Tension, compression, shearing, flexion, impact, torsion, fatigue, hardness, pressure and vibration.

**Tension Test**

![Universal Machine](/static/images/notes/UniversalmachineMaterials.png)

* Tension: Action of opposing forces applied to the cross section of the body.
* Load: Force applied to the material during a tension test or on duty. 
* Stress: Effect of a load on the material per unit area of the cross section.
* Deformation: Change in length per unit of length as a result of a load.
* Tension Test: Measures the resistance of the material to a constant effort.
* Elastic Deformation: Material alteration that can recover by removing the applied force.
* Plastic Deformation: Permanent material alteration that can't be recovered.
* Elasticity or Young's modulus: Slope of the stress-deformation curve in its elastic region.
* Elastic Limit: Stress at which plastic deformation begins.
* Proportional limit: Stress at which the stress-deformation relation is no longer linear.
* Yield or creep stress: Stress just above the elastic limit where the yield region starts.
* Compensated creep resistance: Describes a specific amount of plastic deformation (0.002 or 2%).
* Resilience modulus: Amount of energy the material supports at the creep resistance point.
* Ultimate tensile stress: Maximum stress that the material structure can oppose.
* Resistance to fracture: Maximum stress before the material completely fractures.

	\text{Stress}\\
	\sigma = \frac{F}{A_o}\\
	\text{Deformation}\\
	\epsilon = \frac{\Delta l}{l_o}\\
	\text{Elasticity Modulus}\\
	E = \frac{S}{e} \implies E = \frac{\Delta S}{\Delta e} = \frac{S_f - S_i}{e_f - e_i}\\
	\text{Resilience modulus}\\
	E_r = \frac{1}{2}(R_C)(R_D)\\

**Exercise 1**

An aluminum bar must withstand 45,000 pounds of force. The maximum allowable stress on the bar is 25,000 psi, below the creep resistance of the material. The bar must be 150 in long but must not elongate more than 0.25 in. Design an appropriate bar.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	F = 45000 \, \text{lb} \land l_o = 150\,\text{in} \land l_f = 150.25\,\text{in}\\
	e = \frac{0.25}{150} = 0.0016 \implies S = 16500\,\text{lb/in}^2\\
	A_o = \frac{45000}{16500} = 2.81 \, \text{in}^2\\
	\text{Cylinder}\\
	A_o = \frac{\pi (D)^2}{4} = \frac{\pi (D)^2}{4} = 2.81\\
	D = \sqrt{\frac{2.81 (4)}{\pi}} = 1.89 \, \text{in}\\
	\text{Square}\\
	A_o = (L)^2 \implies L = \sqrt{2.81} = 1.67\,\text{in}^2
\end{gathered}
$$

* Ductility: Capacity to be deformed permanently without breaking. Increases with temperature.
	* Can be measured by the total elongation increase or cross sectional area reduction.
* Brittle: Opposite to ductility, capacity to break or fracture without deformation.
* Stiffness: Capacity to resist elastic deformation.
* Toughness: Capacity to resist a fracture in the presence of internal defects.
	* Related to the total energy the material can absorb before fracture.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Elongation}\\
	E_l = \frac{l_f - l_o}{l_o} \times 100\\
	\text{Area Reduction}\\
	A_r = \frac{A_o - A_f}{A_o} \times 100
\end{gathered}
$$

**Exercise 2**

A 850 lb force is applied to a Nickel Wire with a 0.15 in diameter. The wire has a creep resistance of 45000 psi and a tensile stress of 55000 psi. Determine if the wire will have palstic deformation and if it will be a visible plastic deformation (after tensile stress).

$$
\begin{gathered}
	A = \frac{\pi(0.15)^2}{4} = 0.01767 \, \text{in}^2\\
	S = \frac{850}{0.01767} = 48000 \, \text{lb/in}^2\\
	\text{It will have plastic deformation}\\
	\text{It won't have visible deformation}\\
\end{gathered}
$$

**Exercise 3**

A polymer bar has 1x2x15 in of dimensions and an elasticity modulus of 600000 psi. Calculate the required force to elongate the bar from 15 to 15.25.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	E = 600000 \, \text{lb/in}^2 \land l_o = 15\, \text{in} \land l_f = 15.25 \, \text{in}\\
	e = \frac{\Delta l}{l_o} = \frac{0.25}{15} = 0.016\\
	S = (E)(e) = 600000(0.016) = 10000 \, \text{psi}\\
	F = (S)(A) = (10000)(2) = 20000 \, \text{lb}
\end{gathered}
$$

**Exercise 4**

A wire has 1.25 in in diameter and is 50 ft long, it needs to lift a 20 ton load, what is the length of the cable while on duty if we know it has an elasticity modulus of 30000000 psi.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	A = \frac{\pi (1.23)^2}{4} = 1.2271\,\text{in}^2\\
	F = 20000\,\text{kg}(\frac{2.2\,\text{lb}}{\text{kg}}) = 44000\,\text{lb}\\
	S = \frac{44000}{1.2271} = 35879.82\,\text{psi}\\
	e = \frac{35879.82}{30\times 10^{6}} = 0.00119\\
	\Delta l = 0.00119(50\,\text{ft}) = 0.00119(600\,\text{in}) = 0.71\,\text{in}\\
	l_f = \Delta l + l_o = 600 + 0.71 = 600.71 \,\text{in}
\end{gathered}
$$

**Exercise 5**

A steel bar has a percentage reduction in area of 19.5% and a final diameter of 2.5 in. Calculate the initial diameter.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	A_f = \pi \left(\frac{2.5\,\text{in}}{2}\right)^2\\
	19.5 = \frac{A_o - 4.9087\,\text{in}^2}{A_o} (100)\\
	A_o = 6.0978\,\text{in}^2\\
	D_o = \sqrt{\frac{4(A_o)}{\pi}} = 2.7864\,\text{in}\\
\end{gathered}
$$
