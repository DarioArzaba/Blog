# Materials Introduction #

Materials technology is an interdisciplinary field of science and engineering that studies the composition and structure of materials to take advantage of its properties in its processing. The science is the research that defines the internal structure, properties and process of the materials. The engineering is the application of the gathered knowledge when creating or modifying products. 

The objective of materials technology is to evaluate and characterize materials, determine their possible applications, get a better performance, decrease costs and discover new materials. It also focuses on dematerialization (DEMAT) and Green Engineering meaning that it tries to design processes that minimize pollution, promote sustainability and protect human health without sacrificing viability or efficiency.

# Mechanical Properties #

In engineering, the mechanical properties of the materials are their inherent characteristics that differentiate one from another. When selecting a material one must consider the expected and unexpected loads it might suffer while on duty.

* Should it be strong, rigid or ductile?
* Will it be subjected to the application of a sudden force? (Forces that act momentarily)
* Will it be subjected to the application of a cyclical force? (Changes value, direction or both and returns to the starting point)
* Will it be subjected to constant effort? (Constant forces or with a slow growth rate)

The main objective is to prevent failures such as deformation or fracture. To achieve this goal we must know a material mechanical properties while on their expected use conditions. Examples of mechanical properties under loads are: Tension, compression, shearing, flexion, impact, torsion, fatigue, hardness, pressure and vibration.

**Tension Test**

* Tension is the action of opposing forces applied to the cross section of the body.
* A load is the force applied to the material during a tension test. 
* Stress is the effect of a load per unit area of the cross section.
* Deformation is the change in length per unit of length as a result of a load.
* The tension test measures the resistance of the material to a constant effort.

EXAMPLE

An aluminum bar must withstand an applied force of 45,000 pounds. Figure 6.2 shows the
stress-strain curve for the aluminum alloy to be used. In order for safety to be
infallible, the maximum allowable stress on the bar is limited to 25,000 psi, which is below
the creep resistance of aluminum. The bar must be at least 150 in.long but must not
elastically elongate more than 0.25 in. when force is applied. Design a bar
appropriate.

Comparative elastic behavior of two metals

A component with a high modulus of elasticity will show much smaller changes in
dimensions if the applied stress only causes elastic deformation when
compares with a component with a lower modulus of elasticity

Effect of temperature on the stress-strain graph

Tensile strength, tensile stress and modulus of elasticity decrease at
higher temperatures, while ductility generally increases

material during loading and
subsequently released when
the load is removed
It is the area contained under the portion

Ductility
There are two common measures of ductility:
Elongation percentage quantifies plastic deformation
permanent at fault (does not include elastic deformation
recovered after fracture) by measuring the distance between the
calibrated markings on the specimen before and after testing.
The percentage change in cross-sectional area in the
breaking point before and after the test
