This is an overview of the knowledge needed for evaluating, configuring and installing networks in the industry. Configure device networks, field networks and industrial ethernet using PLC's and HMI's. Requires knowledge of industrial networks and automation.

First class proyect under the European standard:

1. PLC configuration, project creation and communication via MPI.
2. Configuration of sensor-actuator devices in the network.
3. Configuration and programming of decentralized periphery.
4. Configuration and programming of HMI interfaces.
5. Control of motors in decentralized periphery.
6. Supervisory control and data acquisition system via TCP / IP.

Second class proyect under the American standard:

1. Configuration and programming of the main frame by means of the PLC system.
2. Configuration and programming of HMI interfaces.
