This is an overview of the knowledge needed for designing electronic solutions using analog circuits and operational amplifiers. Understand analog circuits that handle linear and non-linear amplification systems, also learn the integration of converters in this systems. Requires knowledge in semiconductors, diodes and transistors.



Welcome
Hello!

We are ready for the summer!

The first installment of your assignments is just around the corner! (Just Kidding)

Welcome to Analysis and Simulation of Mechanisms, considered as an intermediate level course in the engineering area. Therefore, it will be necessary to remember knowledge of subjects such as statics and dynamics, in addition to topics such as free-body diagrams, vector analysis, differential and integral calculus, and rigid-body kinematics and kinetics; which means that this subject is composed of several topics and perhaps that is why we think it is complicated ... but it is not like that!

We will see problems associated with mechanisms commonly used in machines and thus we will acquire skills that allow us to have a clear vision of components such as gears, cams and bars to analyze and simulate different systems.

These topics will help us to better understand the world, to the point where you will say: Oh look, everywhere we can see systems of mechanisms!

Maybe we will get a few hairs ... but we will be here to help you discover how much fun this new adventure will be # Chiche√±oooooooool


Educational intention
It is an intermediate level course, where the student, supported by their previous knowledge (Statics and Dynamics), analyzes, simulates and designs mechanisms with applications in machines, instruments and actuators of various kinds. Requires prior knowledge of: free-body diagrams, vector analysis, differential and integral calculus, and rigid body kinematics and kinetics. As a result of learning, the student recognizes mechanisms commonly used in machines (gin wheel, cams, rack, universal joint, etc.), analyzes and simulates systems that involve gears, cams and bars, selects the most appropriate mechanism components for an application. specific and designs mechanisms based on specific needs.

General objectives
At the end of the course the student will be able to:

- Know different mechanisms used in machines, instruments and actuators.

- Analyze and simulate mechanisms.

- Design a mechanism based on specific requirements.

All this for the cases of flat face and roller translation followers.
