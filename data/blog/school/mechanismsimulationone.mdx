# Kinematics of Mechanisms #

## Definition of Mechanism ##

Kinematics is a subfield of physics describing the motion of points, bodies, and systems *without* considering the forces that cause that movement. Dynamics or kinetics is study of the forces that cause kinematic movement. More specifically kinematics describes position, velocity and acceleration (Speed of a bike) while dynamics describes their forces and interactions (Torque of a motor).

A mechanism is a system of *rigid members* that can move relative to each other by mobile joints creating a kinematic chain and ending in a fixed link. Mechanisms can change between using rotational or linear movement. A machine is a system of mechanisms that transmit and transform the available mechanical energy into the desired motion. A structure is one or more mechanism that have no relative motion between their links as they are designed to carry loads.

## Mechanism Movements ##

**Links and Joints**

A link is a rigid member of a machine or mechanism (including the ground itself), this means that there can't be a change in distance between two arbitrary points of the member. Two or more links can be related with the use of joints form a mechanism. Joints, for example bolts, impose restrictions on the degrees of freedom that one link has relative to another one. 

Minimum number of DoF in a joint that I can have and still consider the system a mechanism is 1, in other words the maximum DoF I can restrict in any joint before being a structure 5.

![Fundamental Kinematic Pairs](/static/images/notes/FundamentalKinematicPairs.jpg)

A kinematic pair is simply a group fundamental joint types and the available DoF they set between two links.

## Degrees of Freedom ##

A degree of freedom is the number of independent coordinates required to ascertain the position of a system or its components, in the real world we have 6 degrees of freedom, 3 translational and 3 rotational. 

**Kutzbach's Criterion**

We use the Chebychev–Grübler–Kutzbach criterion to find the degrees of freedom or mobility of a whole system as long as the system is made on a 2D analysis and there is no joint that allows its links to have more than 2 DoF available, in other words every joint must restrict at least 4 DoF.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Kutzbach Criterion}
	m = 3(n-1) - 2(j_1) - (j_1)\\
	m = \text{ DoF or Mobility}\\
	j_1 = \text{ Complete joints}\\
	j_2 = \text{ Incomplete joints}
\end{gathered}
$$

A complete joint is one that has 1 DoF available, meaning that the other 5 are restricted. An incomplete joint is one that has 2 or more DoF available. As previously said, the Kutzbach criterion only works for incomplete joints with exactly 2 DoF's available, meaning that the other 4 are restricted. The criterion can't be used if the system has planar or spherical kinematic pairs (3 DoF available)

Knowing the value of $m$ we can infer some things about the system, for example if it has $m=2$ I need to know the movement of at least 2 links before I can determine the final state of the rest of them. In summary to determine the final state of a system I must reduce the mobility of the system to 0 by fixing as many links as necessary. Hiperstatic system have a mobility lower than 0, this means that the system is a structure that has redundant DoF restrictions.

![Kutzbach Examples](/static/images/notes/ExampleKutzbackCriterionMechanismSimulation.png)

From the examples we can see that a joint of three or more links must be considered separately as 2 independent joints, this means that the number of complete joints in a multi-link system is the number of links minus one $j_1=\text{ links}-1$ . One of the main exceptions of the Kutzbach criterion happens when we have three or more parallel links of the same size and everyone has a rotational DoF available.

**Grashof's Law**

![Grashof Examples](/static/images/notes/FourBarLinkKineticMechanismSimulation.png)

This relation applies to 2D 4 link systems where one link is known to be fixed. It states that if the relation is true then at least one link must be able to complete a full turn around its joint, generally the smallest joint. Depending on the link that is fixed we will arrive at different types of motion.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Grashof Law}\\
	s + l \le p + q\\
	s = \text{ Smallest Link Length}\\
	l = \text{ Largest Link Length}\\
\end{gathered}
$$

## Mechanisms and Inversion ##

The position of any point P in a given space is the relation it has with respect to the origin or to another point. This relation or path can be represented by a vector, for example the vector that goes from the origin O to the point P $\vec{R_{PO}}$. Also consider that the speed and rotation of a point will always be equal to its linear change in position.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	P = R_{PO} = R^x_{PO}\vec{i} + R^y_{PO}\vec{j} + R^z_{PO}\vec{k}
\end{gathered}
$$

Rotational velocity or acceleration is not defined for a point, in this case a joint, however it is defined for an entire link. For any arbitrary point inside a link rotational velocity or acceleration.



At one point we cannot know how it rotates, the rotations are simply translated into another translation.
When we have a link with many points, the link can rotate with respect to itself, a movement that cannot simply be translated into a translation.
When a link rotates we say that it has an angular velocity.
Taking the principle of the points that make up a link with angular velocity, its motion can be determined as a linear velocity and a linear position change.

Points do not have angular velocity or acceleration, although they are affected by the angular velocity of their link.

** Saw equation **

Vector components of a point with vectors.
Positive values ​​until we use magnitudes, the magnitudes can be negative in reference systems.
