# Networks #

Communication is almost as important as any other vital resource. It creates a boundless world, global communities and information networks. Online services like mail, files and games are managed by specialized servers. Servers (HOSTS) will provide the information that a client (END DEVICE) asks for. Intermediary devices like routers connect the clients to the servers.

# PLC #

A PLC is a programmable logic controller used in any control system, also known as programmable automata. It is a computer used in industrial automation as the controller to execute a set of instructions in electromechanical processes such as assembly lines. Brand examples are Siemens, Allen Bradley, Omron, Mitsubishi, Schneider, Zander Aachen and Crouzet.

**PLC Architecture**

![PLC Architecture](/static/images/notes/PLCArquitectureNetworks.png)

Their architecture is made up of a programming unit that translates code for the CPU. The CPU itself needs a storage unit (memory) and a power unit to execute its operations. The CPU's output is send through a system of Inputs and Outputs into its physical interface that can be divided into Input and Output Modules. 

The CPU is an element capable of reading and interpreting input signals and logic instructions stored in memory to decide what needs to be outputted at any moment. Most PLC CPU's are based on 8, 16 or 32 bit microprocessors that process logic, temporalization, sequencing, and operations as needed. One important characteristic that defines a PLC functionality is how long it takes to make a complete SCAN cycle.

![PLC SCAN](/static/images/notes/PLCscancycleNetworks.png)

The memory unit is where the main program and all its relevant data is stored, they vary according to type and capacity for example ROM, RAM, PROM, EEPROM, etc. Normally memory is specified in K units where 1K represents 1024 words in the memory register. Most PLC's are manufactured for AC power sources but there are some models that accept DC power sources for example in offshore rig operations where DC generators are commonly used. 

**PLC Requirements**

Voltage and current requirements of the PLC and its modules must be correctly supplied to ensure it will provide correct input and output signals. The most common requirements are 120VAC, 220VAC or 24VDC. PLC are preferred in industrial environments to other controllers for their simplicity, sturdiness and their reliable Input and Output interface specifically designed to communicate with modules and other instrumentation like sensors and actuators.

**PLC Programming Language**

PLC programming languages are used to create a program with the necessary control instructions, note that communication between PLC's happens through communication protocols like Profibus, Fieldbus, Modbus, Devicenet, Interbus, etc. Since PLC's are used by many professionals that don't have a programming background it is common to see high level graphic languages and low level textual languages. 

Graphic languages use symbols to declare the instructions but are limited to the available symbol combinations, for example Ladder Logic (relay based) or Logical Symbol Blocks. Textual languages use character string to declare the instructions and are more flexible, for example Instruction List (Assembly based) or Structured Text Language (C and PASCAL based).

# Networks Two #

**Point to Point**

Point to point networks like torrent, are networks where devices can act as clients and servers at the same time. This type of networks are easy to configure, less complex, reduce costs and are mainly used to transfer files or share other devices. Some disadvantages are that they aren't centralized, they are unsecure, not scalable and their performance depends on the available servers at any time.

**End Device and Intermediary Device**

An end device is a point in the network where a message can originate or be received. Examples of end devices are desktops, laptops, printers, IP Phones, tablets or smartphones. Messages can take different routes independent of the end device and through intermediary elements that forward the information, in that way intermediary elements interconnect end devices. Examples of intermediary elements are LAN switches, wireless routers, firewalls, routers and multilayer routers.

Intermediary elements don't store the information they forward but they do keep track of the flow of data to execute data management coordination throughout the network. This information is ultimetly used to make the network more efficient or to report errors and communication failures.

End devices and intermediaries communicate through a physical medium that allows the information to travel. Examples of network medium technologies are metal wires like copper (electrical impulses), glass fibers like optical fiber (light pulses) or wireless like air (frequency modulation of electromagnetic waves).

**Topologies**

![Network Topologies](/static/images/notes/NetworkTopologySymbolsNetworks.png)
![Network Topologies](/static/images/notes/TypesOfTopologiesNetworks.png)

Network topologies or diagrams represent the devices connected to a network using symbols. Devices need a NIC (Network Interface Controller) to interface into a physical network using their ports (device interfaces). Physical network topologies illustrate the placement of the devices and their wiring. Logical network topologies illustrate devices, ports and addressing schemes like IP.

**LAN and WAN**

Networks vary widely depending on their purpose and reach. Local area networks or LAN's are used to interconnect a small number of computers (fewer than a hundred) that are geographically close to each other (houses or small offices). Wide area networks or WAN's are used to interconnect a medium to large number of computers (hundreds to thousands) that are geographically distant from each other (large companies or the internet). 

LAN and WAN abstractions will depend on the geographical area they encompass, the number of expected users, the quantity and services available and on how reliable the network's infrastructure is. LAN's will usually be managed by one person or organization providing high speed bandwidth to its devices while WAN's are generally managed by Internet Service Providers or ISP's providing a link between different LAN's.

**Intranet, Extranet and Internet**

The internet is a global collection of LAN's and WAN's using copper cables, optical fiber cables and wireless transmissions. The internet is not controlled by any person or group however there are several organizations dedicated to helping maintain its physical and logical structure like the ISOC, IAB, IESG, IRSG, IRTF and IETF. 

The intranet is a private collection of LAN's and WAN's accessible only to authorized members of an organization. The extranet is layer built on top of the intranet allowing controlled access to the intranet's data to people related to the organization like clients and collaborators. The internet is the public collection of LAN's and WAN's that everybody is authorized to access.

**ISP Services**

ISP's generally provide to homes and small offices the following services: Wired broadband (Cable), Digital subscriber line (DSL), Cellular network, Satellite or Dialing telephone. Entrepreneurial services include: Leased line, WAN Ethernet (Metro), SDSL or Satellite. Businesses used to be wired using separate telephone, video and data lines, each with its own protocol. Today most services use convergent networks that transport data through a single line. 

**Reliable Architecture**

Every network architecture must meet the following expectations in order to be considered a *Reliable Network*:

* Tolerance to failures: Systems that decrease the impact of failures by limiting the number of affected devices, like redundancy.
* Scalability: The network can easily expand to admit new devices and applications without diminishing the overall performance.
* Quality of Service (QoS): Systems that prioritize workloads by considering the specific needs of the network users.
* Security: Divided into the safety of the infrastructure (physical devices) and the safety of the data stored and transmitted. Its main objectives are:
	* Confidentiality: Only the desired recipients can access the data.
	* Integrity: A guarantee that the data has not been compromised during transmission.
	* Availability: A guarantee that there is a reliable and timely access to the data.

**Network Trends**

There are many trends in todays networks including the bring your own device model (BYOD) where users want to be able to access their data on any device, anywhere. Online collaboration and videoconferences are used in many companies and schools. Video communication is part of everyday life. Cloud computing allows affordable access greater computing power and storage by leasing distant cloud servers.

Today we can find public clouds that are available to the public for free or through a payment model, private clouds used in a specific organization, hybrid clouds configured as a private cloud with a public interface and personalized clouds tailored to the specific needs of an industry such as medical care or high end communication services.

There are some technology trends too like intelligent homes interconnecting appliances, electric line network adapters that allow the use of the electric infrastructure as ethernet or wireless broadband that allow you to connect your devices to a general wireless internet tower (WISP) similar to the cellular network smartphones use.

**Network Security**

Network protection includes protocols, technologies, devices, tools and techniques like dedicated firewalls, access control lists (ACL), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and VPN's to mitigate external and internal threats. External threats can be viruses, trojan, worms, spyware, adware, zero day attacks, denial of service, data interception and identity theft. Internal threats can be lost or stolen devices, accidental misuse or malicious employees.

**Operative System**

Operating systems are built on top of abstraction layers. The hardware is the physical layer that includes the electronic devices of the OS. The kernel is the software-hardware interface in charge of distributing resources. The shell is the software interface and it's the first layer meant for a human intervention. Shells can have a text based (CLI) or graphic based (GUI) interface. 

The CLI is the preferred operating system for network technicians to configure, monitor and control networks. To access the network operating system of a device we can use a *Console* (physical serial port), telnet (unencrypted remote network access) or a secure shell (SSH) that stablishes a secure remote CLI connection using a virtual interface. Telnet and SSH generally use a terminal emulator such as PuTTY, Tera Term or SecureCRT.

**Operative System Commands**

You can execute commands (EXEC Mode) as a user `User>` or as a privileged or root user `User#`, accessed by the command `enable`. The global configuration `Switch(config)#`, accessed by `configure` is where we configure the device. The line configuration `Switch(config-line)#`, accessed by `line` is where we configure a specific terminal. The interface configuration `Switch(config-if)#`, accessed by `interface` is used to configure the ports of the network device. When entering any configuration mode we can exit by simply executing `exit` or pressing `End`.

**Basic Configuration**

**Ports and IP's**




2.4 Basic device configuration
Basic Device Configuration Device Names
The first configuration command on any device should be to give it a unique hostname.
By default, all devices are assigned a factory default name. For example, a Cisco IOS switch is "Switch".

Guide to naming devices:
Start with a letter.
Contain no spaces.
End with a letter or digit.
Use only letters, digits and hyphens.
Be less than 64 characters long.

Note: To return the change to the default prompt, use the global configuration no hostname command.

Using weak or easy-to-guess passwords is a security concern.
All network devices must limit administrative access by ensuring privileged EXEC, user EXEC, and remote Telnet access with passwords. Also, all passwords must be encrypted and legal notifications must be provided.

Password guides
Use passwords that are more than eight characters long.
Use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, or number sequences.
Avoid using the same password for all devices.
Do not use common words because they are easily discovered.

Note: In most labs, we will use simple passwords like cisco or class. These passwords are considered simple and easy to guess, and should be avoided in a production environment.

Basic device configuration Set passwords

Protect user EXEC mode
First enter the line console configuration mode using the command line console 0 in global configuration mode.
Next, set the user EXEC mode password with the password command.
Finally, enable user EXEC access with the login command.

Secure access to privileged EXEC mode
 First enter global configuration mode.
 Then use the enable secret password command.

Basic Device Configuration Set Passwords (Cont.)
Ensure access to the VTY line:
First enter the VTY line configuration mode using the command line vty 0 15 in the global configuration mode.
Then specify the VTY password with the password command.
Finally, enable VTY access with the login command.
Note: VTY lines allow remote access via Telnet or SSH to the device. Many Cisco switches support up to 16 VTY lines that are numbered 0 through 15.
Basic device configuration Encrypt passwords
The startup-config and running-config files show most passwords in plain text.
To encrypt the passwords, use the service password-encryption global configuration command.
Use the show running-config command to verify that the passwords have been encrypted.
Basic Device Settings Banner Messages
A banner message is important to warn unauthorized personnel from trying to access the device.
To create a banner message of the day on a network device, use the banner motd #the message of the day # global configuration command.
Note: The "#" symbol in the command syntax is called a delimiter character. It is entered before and after the message.
The banner will be displayed on attempts to access the device.


2.5 Save settings

Save settings Configuration files
There are two system files that store device settings.
startup-config - This is the saved configuration file that is stored in NVRAM. It contains all the commands that the device will use when starting or restarting. Flash does not lose its content when the device is off.
running-config - This is stored in random access memory (RAM). Reflects current configuration. Modifying a running configuration affects the operation of a Cisco device immediately. RAM is volatile. It loses all content when the device is turned off or restarted.
To save the changes made to the running configuration in the startup configuration file, use the copy running-config startup-config command in privileged EXEC mode.
Saving configurations Modifying the running configuration
If the changes made to the running configuration do not have the desired effect and the running configuration has not yet been saved, you can restore the device to its previous configuration. To do this you can:
Delete the individually modified commands.
Reboot the device with the reload command in privileged EXEC mode. Note: This will cause the device to disconnect briefly, causing network downtime.
If the unwanted changes were saved in the startup configuration, it may be necessary to erase all the configurations using the erase startup-config command in privileged EXEC mode.
After clearing startup-config, reload the device to clear the running-config file from RAM.
Save configurations Capture the configuration to a text file
Configuration files can be saved and archived in a text document.
Step 1 Open a terminal emulation software such as PuTTY or Tera Term connected to a switch.
Step 2. Enable login in the terminal software and assign a file name and location to save the log file. The figure shows that all session results will be captured to the specified file (that is, MySwitchLogs).

Save settings Capture settings to text file (Cont.)
Step 3. Execute the show running-config or show startup-config command at the prompt from the privileged EXEC. The text that appears in the terminal window will be placed in the chosen file.
Step 4. The figure shows disable logging by selecting the None session logging option.
Note: The created text file can be used as a record of how the device is currently deployed. The file may require editing before it can be used to restore a saved configuration to a device.

2.6 Ports and addresses
Ports and addresses IP addresses
The use of IP addresses is the main means of allowing devices to locate each other and to establish complete communication on the Internet.
The structure of an IPv4 address is called “dotted decimal notation” and is represented by four decimal numbers between 0 and 255.
An IPv4 subnet mask is a 32-bit value that separates the network portion of the address from the host portion. Combined with the IPv4 address, the subnet mask determines the particular subnet to which the device belongs.
The default gateway address is the IP address of the router that the host will use to access remote networks, including the Internet.
Ports and addresses IP addresses (Cont.)
IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long and are written as a string of hexadecimal values. Four bits are represented by a single hexadecimal digit, with a total of 32 hexadecimal values. Groups of four hexadecimal digits are separated by a colon ":".
IPv6 addresses are not case sensitive, and can be entered in lowercase or uppercase.
Note: In this course, IP refers to the IPv4 and IPv6 protocols. IPv6 is the latest version of IP and the replacement for the more common IPv4 protocol.

Ports and addresses Interfaces and ports

Network communications depend on end-user device interfaces, network device interfaces, and the cables that connect them.
Types of network media include twisted pair copper cables, fiber optic cables, coaxial cables, and wireless technology.
Different types of network media have different features and benefits. Some of the differences between the various types of media include the following:
The distance over which the media can successfully transport a signal.
The environment in which the medium will be installed.
The amount of data and the speed at which it should be transmitted.
The cost of the media and installation.

2.7 IP address configuration

Configure IP Addressing Manual Configuration of IP Addresses for End Devices
End devices on the network need an IP address to communicate with other devices on the network.
IPv4 address information can be entered into end devices manually or automatically using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).
To configure an IPv4 address manually on a Windows host, open Control Panel> Network and Sharing Center> Change adapter settings and select the adapter. Then right-click and select Properties to display the Local Area Connection Properties.
Then click Properties to open the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP / IPv4) Properties window. Then configure the IPv4 address and subnet mask information, and the default gateway.
Note: IPv6 addressing and configuration options are similar to IPv4.



Configure IP Addressing Automatic IP Address Configuration for End Devices
DHCP allows automatic configuration of IPv4 addresses for each end device that has DHCP enabled.
End devices use DHCP by default for automatic IPv4 address configuration.
To configure DHCP on a Windows PC, open Control Panel> Network Sharing Center> Change adapter settings and choose the adapter. Then right-click and select Properties to display the Local Area Connection Properties.
Next, click properties to open the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP / IPv4) properties window, then select Obtain an IP address automatically and Obtain DNS server address automatically
Note: IPv6 uses DHCPv6 and SLAAC (Stateless Automatic Address Configuration) for dynamic address assignment.

Configure IP addressing Change virtual interface configuration
To access the switch remotely, an IP address and subnet mask must be configured in the SVI.
To configure an SVI on a switch:
Enter the command interface vlan 1 in global configuration mode.
Next, assign an IPv4 address using the command ip address ip-address subnet-mask
Finally, enable the virtual interface using the no shutdown command
