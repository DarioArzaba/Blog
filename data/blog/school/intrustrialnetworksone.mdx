# Networks #

* Communication is almost as important as any other vital resource.
* It creates a boundless world, global communities and information networks.
* Online services like mail, files and games are managed by specialized servers.
* Servers (HOST) will provide the information that a client (END DEVICE) asks for.
* Intermediary devices like routers connect the clients to the servers.
