# Diagnostic #

1. What do you understand by a sensor? Do you know the difference between a sensor and an actuator? A sensor is device that measures a physical magnitude and transforms the measurement into electrical signals. Actuators are devices that use the electrical energy emitted by sensors or controllers transforming it into mechanical energy or motion. Some actuators convert the mechanical energy into electrical energy.
2. What characteristics (static and dynamic) of sensors do you know? Static: Sensitivity, resolution, drift, range, repeatability, reproducibility. Dynamic: Rise, delay, peaks, time error and steady state error.
3. What do you understand by signal conditioning methods? What do you understand by signal conditioning methods? Signal conditioning is the processing of signals to make them suitable as input to other devices like actuators. Examples of methods used in signal conditioning are filtering, amplification, attenuation and linearization.
4. Do you know the operational amplifiers and have used them? What have you done with them? They are electronic components used for amplifying voltage, this amplification is determined by external feedback components. I have used them to design filters, but they can be used as the basis for comparators, rectifiers, converters and most signal conditioning methods.
5. Do you know the types of triangular signals, pulse train, saw tooth? Yes, they represent different signal behaviors or changes over time. Triangular waves mean that the signal increases and decreases linearly. Pulse waves mean that the signal oscillates between on and off, the proportion of time they remain on depends on their duty cycle, square waves are a kind of pulse wave with a duty cycle of 50%. Saw waves are similar to triangular waves in that they increase linearly but can only decrease in a sharp vertical drop, they can be considered an extremely asymmetric triangle wave.
6. What is PWM? Method of decreasing the average power of a signal by dividing its output into a discrete pulse wave, the intervals when the signal is turned off in the pulse wave are what causes the overall power reduction.
7. What do you know about industrial instrumentation and its standards? Not very much. I think it might relate to the correct way of using sensors and actuators in an industrial process.
8. Have you physically used a multimeter or (voltmeter or ammeter), a signal generator (or functions) and an oscilloscope? Yes, I have used a multimeter a function generator and an oscilloscope for basic circuit testing.
9. Have you used Proteus and LabVIEW, what have you done with them (describe as much as you can)? Yes I Have Used Proteus to Create Circuit Schematics and LabView to Create State Machines.
10. What do you expect to learn from the course, what are your expectations? I hope to learn in more detail about the functionality of sensors, actuators and other automation components.
11. Why do you study the engineering you are studying, that you motivate you? In what area would you like to work in industry, academy, scientific research, consulting? Because I love to know how things work and then be able to modify or create my own devices. I want to work in the industry surrounding neural networks, researching how they can be incorporated into automation or robotics.
12. Do you work or are doing professional practices? In a positive case, where, and what are your responsibilities? what is your work schedule? Currently I'm not doing any intership but I plan on looking out for one next semester.
13. Do you want remote classes? Yes

**Theory**

Inductance is the property of an inductor of reacting to a change in its current by changing the energy of its magnetic field and generating an opposite voltage (counter electromotive force). The voltage of an inductor therefore must relate to a change in current $V_L = L(\frac{di}{dt})$ where L is the inductance constant of proportionality measured in Henrys.

The capacitance constant of the geometric configuration is the amount of charge that two bodies with a constant shape and spacing can store per volt-difference between them. This relation can be expressed as $C=\frac{q}{V}$

**Capacitance Printed Value**

The capacitance is normally printed in most plastic film types usually as micro or nano farads. Tolerances use upper case letters (M=±20%, K=±10%, J=±5%, H=±2.5% and F=±1pF), with K being the most common. Working voltage is also usually printed with a (V): 150n = 150nF; u47 = 0.47uF; 4n7 = 4.7nF.

Some capacitors use a three digit number system where the third digit is a picofarad multimeter: 474K 63 = 47x1^4pF = 0.47uF 63VDC ±10%; 102K 50 = 10x1^2pF = 0.001uF 50VDC ±10%.

Ceramic disk capacitors generally contain thermal tolerances (Z5U, K5U, X7R, COH, N2200). Whole numbers are usually pF and decimal numbers in uF. Odd looking numbers may use the three digit number system.

## Questions ##

1. In your own words what are the objectives and procedure of the practice? The main objective was to learn how to measure capacitance or inductance using instruments like the AC Voltmeter instead of using the  Multimeter. The procedure was to place the capacitor or the inductor in series with a resistance and using by using both voltages being able to solve for their values, in the case of the inductor we took into account the internal resistance of the component as an additional resistor in series.
2. You have all the necessary material to carry out the practice (not including multimeters, power supplies, oscilloscopes, or power generators signals / functions)? Yes, using the Proteus Simulator we can find all the necessary material to complete the practice.
3. What is the difference between a ceramic capacitor, a variable capacitor and a electrolytic capacitor? Ceramic capacitors are non polarized and made with a ceramic dielectric, they have a high frequency response but low voltage ratings. Variable capacitors are capacitors used when a continuous variation of the capacitance is needed (transmitters, receivers), they work by changing the distance or plate area overlap to control their capacitance. Electrolytic capacitors are polarized capacitors made up of a metallic anode covered with an oxidized layer used as dielectric and a solid or wet electrolyte as its cathode. Electrolytic capacitors generally can't be used in AC circuits because of their polarity but have a high capacitance.

**Theory**

Power is the work done per unit of time, expressed in Joules per second. Electrical power is the work or energy dissipated in a certain load per unit of time, expressed in Watts. The power in DC in a load is $P = V_L I_L$ therefore it can be measured simply by using an Ammeter and a Voltmeter.

The direct measurement of the load voltage and current may be different because of the internal resistances of the Ammeter and Voltmeter. The difference can be of the order of $\frac{|R_L - R_I|}{R_L}$ where $R_L$ is the load's resistance and $R_I$ is the instrument's resistance.

In AC circuits we use the *3 Voltmeter* method. In this configuration the real power dissipated by the load is $P = \frac{V_m I_m}{2}$ to do the previous calculation we need to use $R$ since we don't know the current, therefore ending with the relation: 

$$
P_L = \frac{V_{AC}^2 - V_{AB}^2 - V_{BC}^2}{2R}
$$

**List of Components**

* 1 Power source, 1 Autotransformer, 3 Multimeters

**Questions**

1. In your own words what are the objectives and procedure of the practice? The main objective was to learn how to measure the power being used by a general load represented in this case by a power resistor using instruments like the Voltmeter and Ammeter instead of using a Multimeter. The procedure was to place the load in series with a DC source first, here we can directly measure the voltage and current needed to calculate the power of the load, only taking into account the small error that could arise from the internal resistance of the instruments. Later on we used the 3 voltmeter method when applying an AC signal to the load, this method requires the help of an additional resistance.
2. You have all the necessary material to carry out the practice (not including multimeters, power supplies, oscilloscopes, or power generators signals / functions)? Yes, using the Proteus Simulator we can find all the necessary material to complete the practice.
3. In what type of energy is the potential and kinetic energy of the free electrons that flow inside a conductor transformed? Is this process reversible? Into usable electrical energy and some thermal. The process is not completely reversible as some of the energy will be lost.

**Theory**

Circuit bridges are devices used in measuring instruments that measure unknown resistances, capacitances or inductances. Bridges use DC sources when measuring resistances and AC sources when measuring inductances or capacitances. We are able to make the comparison when there is no current flowing through the galvanometer, meaning that the voltage on its terminals is the same (bridge in equilibrium). 

![Wheatstone Bridge](/static/images/notes/WheatstoneBridgeImageIntruLab.png)

The Wheatstone Bridge is used when measuring resistances and uses a DC source.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\frac{R_1}{R_4} = \frac{R_2}{R_x} \implies R_x = \frac{R_2 R_4}{R_1}\\\\
	V_A = (V_S)\left(\frac{R_4}{R_4 + R_1}\right)\\
	V_B = (V_S)\left(\frac{R_x}{R_x + R_2}\right)\\
	V_{AB} = V_A - V_B \land V_{AB} = 0 \implies V_A = V_B\\
	(V_S)\left(\frac{R_4}{R_4 + R_1}\right) = (V_S)\left(\frac{R_x}{R_x + R_2}\right)\\
	\left(\frac{R_4}{R_4 + R_1}\right) = \left(\frac{R_x}{R_x + R_2}\right)\\
	(R_4)(R_x + R_2) = (R_x)(R_4 + R_1)\\
	R_4 R_x + R_4 R_2 = R_x R_4 + R_x R_1\\
	R_4 R_2 = R_x R_1 \therefore R_x = \frac{R_2 R_4}{R_1}
\end{gathered}
$$

The resistance itself of $R_x$ can vary by a small amount $\Delta R$ from phenomena like thermal changes, its new resistance will be $R_x = R_x + \Delta R$ . This small variation in the unknown resistance needs to be taken into account to measure the *true* voltage differential $V_{AB}$ that we will use for example when measuring the temperature with a thermistor.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	V_A = (V_S)\left(\frac{R_4}{R_4 + R_1}\right)\\
	V_B = (V_S)\left(\frac{R_x}{R_x + R_2 \pm \Delta R}\right)\\
	\pm\Delta V_{AB} = V_A - V_B\\
	V_A - V_B = (V_S)\left(\frac{R_4}{R_4 + R_1}\right) - (V_S)\left(\frac{R_x}{R_x + R_2 \pm \Delta R}\right)\\
	V_A - V_B = (V_S)\left(\frac{R}{R + R}\right) - (V_S)\left(\frac{R}{R + R \pm \Delta R}\right)\\
	V_{AB} = (V_S)\left(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{R}{2R \pm \Delta R} \right)\\
	V_{AB} = (V_S)\left(\frac{2R \pm \Delta R - 2R}{4R \pm \Delta R}\right)\\
	V_{AB} = \left(\frac{V_S}{4R}\right)\\
	\pm\Delta V_{AB} = \pm \Delta R\left(\frac{V_S}{4R}\right)
	\therefore \Delta R = \left(\frac{V_{AB} 4 R}{V_S}\right)
\end{gathered}
$$

DeltaResistor = (Vab*4*R2)/-Vsource 

From the equation we see that the maximum voltage differential from a small variation in $R_x$ happens when $R_1 = R_4 \text{ and } R_2 = R_x$ . 

![Capacitance Bridge](/static/images/notes/CapacitanceComparisonBridgeIntruLab.png)

The Capacitance Comparison Bridge is used when measuring inductances or capacitances and uses an AC source. When balanced we know that:

$$
R_x = \frac{R_2 R_4}{R_1} \text{ and } C_x = \frac{R_1 C_4}{R_2} 
$$

![Resonance Bridge](/static/images/notes/ResonanceBridgeInstruLab.png)

Resonance Bridges are used when measuring frequencies from a balance condition. When balanced we know that:

$$
f = \frac{1}{(2 \pi \sqrt{LC})} 
$$

**List of Components**

* 1 Power Source, Oscilloscope, Function Generator, Multimeter
* 1 capacitor 0.22uF and 1 capacitor 0.33uF, 1 Thermistor 4.7kOhm
* 1 Preset of 100Ohm, 1 Potentiometer of 10kOhm and 1 potentiometer of 5kOhm
* Resistors: 4 2.2Ohm, 3 56kOhm, 2 10kOhm, 2 4.7kOhm
* Resistors: 1 47kOhm, 1 1kOhm, 1 2.2kOhm, 1 3.9kOhm, 1 1Ohm

## Experiment 1 ##

**Thermistor with Wheatstone**

1. Build a Wheatstone Bridge using R1 = R4 = 10kΩ
2. R2 = 10kΩ potentiometer. Rx = PTC Thermistor
4. Power Source is 10VDC
5. Take 3 measurements: 25°C, 40°C, 120°C.
6. Indicate voltages, potentiometer and thermistor resistance.

$$
R_x = \frac{R_2 R_4}{R_1}
$$

| Temp | Voltages | Potentiometer | Thermistor | 
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 25 | 5-5 | 1000 | $\frac{(1k)(10k)}{10k} = 1k$ |
| 40 | 5.08-4.92 | 1100 | $\frac{(1.1k)(10k)}{10k} = 1.1k$ |
| 120 | 5.09-4.91 | 1500 | $\frac{(1.5k)(10k)}{10k} = 1.5k$ |

In this experiment we learned to measure the unknown resistance of a PTC thermistor using a Wheatstone Bridge. The derivation of the equation we used to calculate the resistance refers to equating the voltages of the two voltage dividers.

Since there is still some current traveling in the middle value of the second and third test it’s safe to assume that the true value of the unknown resistance would be approximately 1050Ω and 1450Ω respectively.

## Experiment 2 ##

**Resistor Temp Variation Wheatstone**

1. Build a Wheatstone Bridge using R1 = R4 = R2 = 56kΩ
2. R3 = 10kΩ potentiometer + 47k Ω
3. Power Source is 10VDC, balance the bridge with R3
4. Heat the 47k Ω resistor to a small increase (47.1k Ω)
5. Observe the voltage variation and calculate the resistor change.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	V_{AB} = \Delta R\left(-\frac{V_S}{4R_2}\right) \implies \Delta R = \left(\frac{V_{AB} 4 R_2}{-V_S}\right)\\
	V_{1} = -0.12mV \land V_{2} = -2.35mV\\
	V_{AB} = -2.23mV\\
	\Delta R = \left(\frac{(-0.00223)(4)(56000)}{-(10)}\right) = 49.952 \Omega \approx 50 \Omega\\
	\therefore \Delta R = 50
\end{gathered}
$$

In this experiment we learned how most resistors, when subjected to a change in temperature will respond with a change in their resistance (in the same way as a thermistor does), in this case by simulating a change of 50 Ω in the 47k Ω resistor we are also unbalancing the bridge with a net deflection in its voltage reading. 

By knowing the magnitude of the voltage difference, we are able to calculate the unknown change in the resistor caused by a change in temperature. The relation between the resistance difference and the voltage difference also refers to equating the voltages of the two voltage dividers.

## Experiment 3 ##

**Capacitance comparison bridge**

1. Build a Capacitance Comparison Bridge using Z2 = Z4 = 47Ω
2. Z1 = 100 Ω potentiometer + C4 = 0.22uF and Cx = 0.33uF.
3. Power Source is AC 2Sin(2000pi t) V
4. Measure the value of the potentiometer
5. Calculate unknown Cx and Rx from the potentiometer value.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	C_x = \frac{(69\Omega)(0.22\,\mu \text{F})}{(47\Omega)} = 0.3229787234 \,\mu \text{F} \approx 0.323 \,\mu \text{F}\\
	E_a = |X_m - X_t| = |0.323 - 0.33| = 0.007 \,\mu \text{F}\\
	E_r = \frac{|X_m - X_t|}{X_t} = \frac{0.007 \,\mu \text{F}}{0.33 \,\mu \text{F}} \times 100\% = 2.128 \%\\
	R_x = \frac{(47\Omega)(47\Omega)}{(69\Omega)} = 32.01449275 \Omega \approx 32.0145\Omega\\
	E_a = |X_m - X_t| = |32.0145 - 100| = 67.985 \Omega\\
	E_r = \frac{|X_m - X_t|}{X_t} = \frac{67.985 \Omega}{100 \Omega} \times 100\% = 67.985 \%
\end{gathered}
$$

In this experiment we learned to measure the unknown resistance and capacitance of two components using a Capacitor Comparison Bridge, which in some regards can be considered a variation of the Wheatstone Bridge designed to use an AC source by including additional impedances in equilibrium. Like in previous bridges we can calculate the value of the resistance and the capacitance simply by balancing the bridge using both potentiometers.

## Questions ##

1. In your own words, what are the objectives and the procedure of the practice? The main objective was to learn how use bridges as part of measuring instruments for unknown impedances, for example to detect the small changes in the resistance of a transducer like the thermistor. The procedure was to place the component with the unknown value on one side of the bridge and a variable component equivalent on the other, between them stands a null detector to indicate that the bridge is balanced when adjusting the variable component. Once balanced we can calculate the impedance from the principle of voltage dividers.
2. Do you have all the necessary material to do the practice (not including: multimeters, power sources, oscilloscopes or signal generators / functions)? Yes
3. What is the difference between the Wheatstone bridge, the capacitance comparison bridge and the resonance point? The Wheatstone Bridge is used when measuring resistances and uses a DC source. The Capacitance Comparison Bridge is used when measuring inductances or capacitances and uses an AC source. Resonance Bridges are used when measuring frequencies in an AC inductive or capacitive circuit.
4. In general, how are measuring bridges balanced? By changing the variable resistance of one of the resistors, using a potentiometer for example, while measuring the current flowing in the middle through the galvanometer, we say that the bridge is balanced when the current reaches zero.
