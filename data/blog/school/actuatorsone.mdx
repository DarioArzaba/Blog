# Introduction #

Mechatronic System: Measures signals, processes them and generates an action through actuators. 

1. Structure: Body of the system, how we integrate components.
2. Sensors: Devices that detect physical magnitudes and transforms them to signals.
3. Actuators: Devices that perform actions in response to signals.
4. Controllers: Regulate actuators response time and logic.
5. Interface: Devices that allow two or more systems to interact.

**Mechatronic System Components**

1. Actuators: Solenoid, DC Motor, Stepper Motor, Servomotor, Hydraulic, Pneumatic.
2. Sensors: Interrupter, Potentiometer, Photoelectric, Encoder, Thermocouple, Accelerometer, MEM.
3. Input Signal Conditioning: Discrete Circuits, Amplifiers, Filters, Converters, Transformers.
4. Control Architectures: Logic Circuits, Microcontrollers, PLC, Control Algorithms.
5. Output Signal Conditioning: Amplifiers, Transistors, Op-Amps.
6. Interfaces: LED, Digital Screens, LCD, CRT.

**Control System**

![Control System Example](/static/images/notes/ControlSystemExample.png)

Interconnection of components in a configuration that gives you the desired response or *output signal* with respect to the reference *input signal* we have selected. Control systems allow us to detect a variable and then execute the actions needed to modify its value into the range of values we want. We can find control systems on most systems, for example in animals, machines or businesses. 

**Open Loop Control System**

![Open Loop System](/static/images/notes/OpenLoopControlSystem.png)

Here the output generated depends directly on the input, meaning that we don't compare the controlled output with the reference signal.

![Open Loop System Example](/static/images/notes/OpenLoopControlSystemExample.png)

For example a simple valve. Here the water flow is the input, the valve's position is the element of control, water level in the tank can be the element of correction, filling the tank is the process and maintaining the tank at a certain level is the controlled variable output.

**Closed Loop of Feedback Control System**

![Open Loop System](/static/images/notes/ClosedLoopControlSystem.png)

Here the output generated depends on the input and the corrections performed by the feedback signal, meaning that we compare the controlled output with the reference signal. The difference between the feedback and the input is the error signal used by the controller to drive the actuators needed to change the output closer to the reference. The cycle repeats when the sensor takes additional measurements.

![Open Loop System Example](/static/images/notes/ClosedLoopControlSystemExample.png)

For example, in a heating system the expected temperature is set in a thermostat as a reference or set point, a sensor measures the temperature output and compares it with the reference, their error is then used by the controller to modify the valves of a gas furnace, this generates a feedback signal in the form of new heat that in turn changes output. The cycle repeats as the sensor takes another measurement.

**Actuator**

A device that transforms energy to a desired motion or action, the control system *drives* the actuator by translating the controller's output into a usable signal.

**Actuator Classification**

1. Pneumatic: Transforms the energy of compressed air into to work like linear or circular motion. High power output from low applied force. 
2. Hydraulic: Transforms the energy of incompressible fluids, generally mineral oil, into work. Highest power output from low applied force. 
3. Electric: Transforms electrical energy into mechanical work. Lower overall torque but faster and more precise movements.

**Magnetic Field Concepts**

* Magnetic field $B$: Field that influences moving charges, electric currents and magnetic materials by inducing magnetic forces.
* Magnetic field intensity or strength $H$: Amount of magnetizing force in space. Measured in ampere per meter equal to an ampere-turn per meter $At/m$.
* Magnetic flux density $B$: Amount of magnetic force induced on a body due to a magnetizing force. Measured in tesla $T$.
* Magnetic flux $\Phi$: Surface integral of the flux lines over a surface. Measured in weber $Wb$.
* Magnetization $M$: Capability of a particular magnetic field strength to increase the magnetic flux density of a material.
* Magnetomotive Force $mmf$: Magnetic force that drives the motion of the magnetic flux through a body.

# Electromagnetic Actuators #

![Linear and Rotational Example](/static/images/notes/LinearandRotationalActuators.png)

Electromagnetic actuators an be classified into *Linear*, for example a solenoid valve, or *Rotational*, for example an electric motor. They are made from magnetic circuits with ferromagnetic or magnetic materials that shape and direct magnetic fields. The magnetic fields are used as a medium (electromagnetic energy) to convert from electrical energy into mechanical energy.

Permanent magnets and a layer of air in rotating machines help maintain the high flux needed to create a large torque. In most electrical machines (except permanent magnet machines) the magnetic flux is produced simply by driving a current through coils wound around a ferromagnetic core.

***

## Electromagnetic Relations ###

**i-H Relation**

![Relationship Magnetic Actuators](/static/images/notes/iHRelationActuators.png)

There is a direct relation between the current in a conductor and the magnetic field strength around it. First the direction of the flux lines can be determined by the *right hand rule*. The relation can be derived from *Ampere's Circuit Law*, stating that the line integral of the magnetic field $B$ around any closed path, when taking incremental steps $dl$, is equal to the total current $i$ linked by the contour times the medium's permeability $\mu_0$.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Ampere's Law}\\
	\oint \vec{B} \, \vec{dl} = (\mu_0)(i)\\
	\oint \vec{H} \, \vec{dl} \, \cos(\theta) = \sum i\\
	\text{Circle with one current}\\
	\oint H \, dl = i \implies H \oint dl = i\\
	(H)(2 \pi r) = i \implies H = \frac{i}{2 \pi r}\\\\
	\text{i H Relation}\\
	\boxed{H = \frac{i}{2 \pi r}}
\end{gathered}
$$

By relating the magnetic field strength that surrounds a conductor to its current we can see that:

1. H will be the same at every point along the contour (magnetic field symmetry).
2. H is proportional to the current passing through the conductor.
2. H is inversely proportional to the radius of the contour.

**B-H Relation**

As H increases so does the magnetic flux density $B$. Permeability $\mu$ represents how easily the flux lines can pass through the medium before reaching its saturation point. In ferromagnetic materials such as iron, cobalt and nickel their relative permeability $mu_r$ varies from 100's to 1000's, for electric machines the value typically ranges from 2000 to 6000. We can see that:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{B H Relation}\\
	B = (\mu)(H) \, \text{T}\\
	\mu = (\mu_0)(\mu_r) \, \text{H/m}\\
	\mu_0 = 1.256637062 \times 10^{-6}
\end{gathered}
$$


1. A high $H$ will produce a high $B$ through the medium.
2. A high $\mu$ implies that a large $B$ will be obtained from a small current.

**Solenoid Field**

![Solenoid Field](/static/images/notes/SolenoidFieldActuators.png)

When we arrange a conductor into a coil we generate a uniform magnetic field, we call this arrangement a solenoid. As the solenoid increases in length we can see from its electromagnetic symmetry that the flux lines cancel each other out until the only lines remaining are the ones parallel to the solenoid's length. Every single horizontal line inside the solenoid gets amplified by the sum of the individual conductor loops flux lines therefore greatly increasing the overall flux density. 

![Ideal Solenoid Field](/static/images/notes/IdealSolenoidActuators.png)

If we consider an ideal solenoid (infinitely large) then the outside horizontal lines go in opposite directions canceling each other out, furthermore even if the solenoid isn't infinite the density of the outside flux lines is still negligible since their magnetic loop around the solenoid covers a far greater volume. Using an ideal solenoid and applying Ampere's Law to any contour, for example a rectangle where the current passes through, gets us the solenoid field equations:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\oint B \, dl = \int_a^b B \, dl + \int_b^c B \, dl + \int_c^d B \, dl + \int_d^a B \, dl\\
	\int_a^b B (0) = 0 \land  \int_c^d B \, (0) = 0\\
	\int_d^a B \, dl = 0 \text{ (ideal solenoid)}\\
	\oint B \, dl = \int_b^c B \, dl\\
	\text{Closed i in Rectangle}\\
	\sum i = i = (i_0)(n)(l)\\
	i_0 = \text{ Applied Current}\\
	\text{Ampere's Circuit Law}\\
	\oint \vec{B} \, \vec{dl} = (\mu_0)(i)\\
	(B)(l) = (\mu_0)((i_0)(n))\\
	n = \text{ Turns per unit of length}\\\\
	\text{Solenoid Field Equation}\\
	B = (\mu_0)(i_0)(n)
\end{gathered}
$$

This equation states that the flux density inside an ideal solenoid doesn't depend on the radius to the conductor or its overall length just on the current applied and the total number of turns per unit of length. We can see that:

1. To increase the $B$ in a solenoid we can increase the applied current or the number of turns by unit of length.

***

## Magnetic Equivalent Circuit ##

![Toroid Only](/static/images/notes/CreatingAToroidActuators.png)

A magnetic circuit can be made by looping a solenoid around a ferromagnetic toroid core so that most of the flux density will remain inside.  Here the solenoid field equation remains almost the same only that this time the unit of length instead of being the length of the solenoid will be the circumference of the toroid: $l = 2\pi r$.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Solenoid Field Equation}\\
	\oint \vec{B} \, \vec{dl} = (\mu)(n)(i) \land n = \frac{N}{l}\\
	B = (\mu)(H) \implies \oint \vec{H} \, \vec{dl} = (N)(i)\\\\
	\text{Magnetomotive Force}\\
	F = (H)(l) = (H)(2 \pi r) = (N)(i)\\
	\text{Toroid Magnetic Circuit}\\
	H = \frac{(N)(i)}{l}\\
	B = (\mu)\frac{(N)(i)}{l}\\
\end{gathered}
$$

Since we are using a ferromagnetic core then $\mu$ must be considered relative to vacuum. From the equation of $H$ inside the toroid we can now calculate the flux $\Phi$ at any cross sectional area of the core.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\Phi = \int B \, dA \implies \Phi = (B)(A)\\
	B = (\mu)\frac{(N)(i)}{l} \implies \Phi = (\mu)\frac{(N)(i)(A)}{l}\\
	\Phi = \frac{(N)(i)}{\frac{l}{(\mu)(A)}} \implies \Phi = \frac{(N)(i)}{\Re}\\
	\Re = \frac{l}{(\mu)(A)} = \frac{1}{P}\\
	\Re = \text{ Magnetic Path Reluctance}\\
	P = \text{ Magnetic Path Permeance}\\\\
	\text{Magnetic Flux Inside the Core}\\
	\Phi = (\mu)\frac{(N)(i)(A)}{l} = \frac{(N)(i)}{\Re}
\end{gathered}
$$

![Equivalent Magnetic Circuit](/static/images/notes/EquivalentMagneticCircuitInActuators.png)

We can use our knowledge of electric circuits with this magnetic circuit by equating the Magnetomotive Force $F$ to the Electromotive Force $E$ , the Flux flow $\Phi = \frac{F}{\Re}$ to the Current $i = \frac{E}{R}$ and the Magnetic Path Reluctance $\Re = \frac{l}{(\mu)(A)}$ to the Resistance $R = \frac{l}{(\sigma)(A)}$. The main difference being that in this case power dissipation is not associated with reluctance.

**Magnetization Curve**

![Magnetization Curve](/static/images/notes/MagnetizationCurvesInActuators.png)

The magnetization curve represents how much $B$ will increase inside the material as we increase $H$, by driving a higher current for example. This relation is linear at low $H$ values but at some point the material will reach its saturation region. Note that the linear region is characterized by a low reluctance and the saturation region by a high reluctance. We can see that:

1. For different materials a different field strength is needed to achieve the same magnetic flux density.

***

## Magnetic Circuit with Air Gap ##

![Rotational Machine](/static/images/notes/RotationalMachineWithEquivalentActuators.png)

In rotating machines we leave an air gap between the core (rotor) and the solenoid (stator). This air gap is necessary to maintain the *frictionless* rotation of the motor shaft, in small motors its length is reduced to balanced the electromagnetic energy losses it produces but on bigger motors its length may be increased to protect the rotor from being pulled into contact with the stator. 

Air gaps introduce higher $F$ requirements to maintain the same flux density $\Phi$ inside the core however they allow the rest of the core to reach its saturation point safely. In the equivalent magnetic circuit model we account for air gaps as an additional reluctances $\Re_g$.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\Re_c = \frac{l_c}{(\mu_c)(A_c)} \land \Re_g = \frac{l_g}{(\mu_0)(A_g)}\\
	\Phi = \frac{(N)(i)}{\Re} = \frac{(N)(i)}{\Re_c + \Re_g}\\
	F = (N)(i) = (H)(l) \implies (H)(l) = (H_c)(l_c) + (H_g)(l_g)\\
	\Phi = (B)(A) \implies B_c = \frac{\Phi_c}{A_c} \land B_g = \frac{\Phi_g}{A_g}
\end{gathered}
$$

**Fringing Effect**

Since the air gap isn't contained inside a solenoid, flux lines will start to bulge outwards when magnetizing the core, this is known as the fringing effect. To account for then we normally increase the cross sectional area of the air gap therefore *capturing* the additional flux lines. Most of the time, if the air gap is relatively small, the fringing effect can be neglected.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Neglecting Fringing Effect}\\
	A_c = A_g = A\\
	B_c = B_g = B = \frac{\Phi}{A}\\\\
	\text{Magnetic Circuit Air Gap}\\
	F = (N)(i) = (H_c)(l_c) + (H_g)(l_g)\\
	B = \frac{\Phi}{A}
\end{gathered}
$$

***

## Magnetic Circuit Inductance ##

The coil used in the magnetic circuit as the flux source can be thought of as an inductor where the inductance of the coil is defined as the Magnetic Flux Linkage $\lambda$ per Ampere of current:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\lambda = (N)(\Phi)\\
	L = \frac{\lambda}{i} = \frac{(N)(\Phi)}{i} = \frac{(N)(B)(A)}{i} = \frac{(N)(\mu)(H)(A)}{i}\\
	L = \frac{(N)(\mu)(H)(A)}{\frac{H(l)}{N}} = \frac{(\mu)(A)(N)^2}{l} = \frac{N^2}{\Re}\\\\
	\text{Flux Linkage and Inductance}\\
	\lambda = (N)(\Phi)\\
	L = \frac{N^2}{\Re}
\end{gathered}
$$

***

## Hysteresis ##

![Hysteresis Curves](/static/images/notes/HysteresisCurvesMagnetActuators.png)

Magnetic hysteresis, from the Greek word of *being late*, means that the magnetic material will retain some residual magnetic flux acquired through the increase of the magnetic field strength. Once the material is magnetized an opposite magnetic field strength is needed to demagnetize the material, this is called the coercivity or coercive force.

Depending on the material, the current applied and the magnetic saturation you can form hysteresis curves of different shapes and sizes, in practice the bigger the hysteresis curve the lower the current needed to keep the core magnetized, the tradeoff is that this will also lower the overall response time of the actuator.

**Sinusoidal Excitation**

![Sinusoidal Excitation](/static/images/notes/SinusoidalExitationActuators.png)

When you apply an AC voltage source (with its corresponding current) to a magnetic circuit this will produce a sinusoidal excitation, since the coil acts as an inductor we will see a phase angle between the induced voltage and the magnetic flux. The relation between the induced voltage and the magnetic flux is determined by Faraday's Law.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\Phi(t) = \Phi_{max}(\sin(\omega (t)))\\
	\Phi_{max}  = \text{ Flux Amplitude}\\
	\omega  = 2\pi f = \text{ Angular Frequency}\\
	\text{Faraday's Law}\\
	e(t) = N\frac{d\Phi}{dt}\\
	e(t) = (N)(\Phi_{max})(\omega)(\cos(\omega (t)))\\
	e(t) = E_{max}(\cos(\omega (t)))\\
	E_{rms} = \frac{E_{max}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{(N)(\Phi_{max})(\omega)}{\sqrt{2}}\\\\
	\text{Voltage Flux Relation}\\
	E_{rms} = (4.44)(N)(f)(\Phi_{max})
\end{gathered}
$$

**Permanent Magnet**

![Permanent Magnet](/static/images/notes/PermanentMagnetHysteresisCurveActuators.png)

By introducing a material with high hysteresis into the magnetic circuit path we are creating a permanent magnet. This permanent magnet will help maintain the magnetic flux we obtain with little to none additional current, generally the high hysteresis component or hard iron is made from iron, nickel or cobalt while the rest of the unmagnetized core is called the soft iron. 

Ideally after magnetizing the hard iron with a positive magnetic field and removing the applied current the permanent magnet will retain its maximum magnetic flux (point a), this is called its operating point. With a negative magnetic field ($-H_1$) we can adjust the operating point of the permanent magnet (to point b). 

From the hysteresis loop and the presence or absence of the keeper, the magnetic flux will be confined to the recoil line (line b to c) between the operating point (b) and the vertical axis (a). Note that removing the keeper makes the air gap the active magnetic field region of the circuit, meaning that the electromotive force of the air gap $F_g$ will equal the electromotive force of the permanent magnet $F_m$. Therefore, assuming no leakage, no fringing and no soft iron reluctance:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	F_g = F_m \implies (H_m)(l_m) + (H_g)(l_g) = 0\\
	H_g = (H_m)\left(\frac{-l_m}{l_g}\right)\\
	\Phi = (B_m)(A_m) = (B_g)(A_g)\\
	B_m = \frac{(A_g)(B_g)}{(A_m)}\\
	B_g = (\mu_0)(H_g)\\\\
	\text{Permanent Magnet with Air Gap}\\
	(H_m)(l_m) + (H_g)(l_g) = 0
	\text{Shear Line Equation}\\
	B_m = -\frac{(\mu_0)(A_g)(l_m)(H_m)}{(A_m)(l_g)}
\end{gathered}
$$

![Shear Line](/static/images/notes/ShearLineImageDemagnetizeActuators.png)

The shear line equation represents the straight line that passes through the origin and the operating point of the permanent magnet, the intersection between the shear line and the demagnetization curve determines the new operating values (B and H) of the permanent magnet (hard iron). Note that if we reinsert the keeper then the operating point will move up the recoil line. 

$$
\begin{gathered}
	V_m = (A_m)(l_m)\\
	V_m = \frac{(B_g)(A_g)(H_g)(l_g)}{(B_m)(H_m)}\\
	V_m = \frac{(B_g)^2(V_g)}{(\mu_0)(B_m)(H_m)}
\end{gathered}
$$

The shear line equation can be used to relate volume of the hard iron needed to maintain a particular magnetic flux density inside the air gap. Note that since the hard iron removes the need of an applied current we can usually neglect the reluctance of the soft iron in the equivalent magnetic circuit.

# Energy Conversion #

![Energy Conversion](/static/images/notes/EnergyConversionDiagramStepsActuators.png)

The principle of conservation of energy is widely used when calculating the force or torque developed in an energy conversion machine. The electromechanical converter system has an electrical system, a mechanical system and a coupling field between them. 

* The electrical energy loss is mainly due to heating in the wires, this is known as the $i^2R$ resistance loss of the winding. 
* The magnetic field energy loss is due to the increase in the stored field energy of the core's field, also known as core loss. 
* Mechanical energy loss is due to friction and windage losses of moving components. All losses are converted into heat.

Neglecting the small resistance loss we know that the changes in the electrical energy applied $dW_e$ during a time interval $dt$ will produce a change in the energy supplied to the field (stored and lost) $dW_f$ and in the final mechanical energy $dW_m$ (useful and lost).

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Conservation of Energy}\\
	dW_e = dW_f + dW_m 
\end{gathered}
$$

***

## Energy Conversion Process ##

**Stored Field Energy**

![Energy Relay Example](/static/images/notes/FieldEnergyStoredInConversionActuators.png)

For example if we consider a relay where there is a movable part that is kept in static equilibrium by a spring $dW_m=0$ then every change in electrical energy will translate directly into a change in the magnetic field energy $dW_e=dW_f$. From this conditions we can calculate the change in electrical energy and the change in magnetic energy in the relay:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Faraday's Law}\\
	e(t) = \frac{N d\Phi}{dt}\\
	\lambda = (N)(\Phi) \implies e(t) = \frac{d\lambda}{dt}\\\\
	\text{Electrical and Field Energy Change}\\
	dW_e = (e)(i)(dt) \land dW_f = (i)(d\lambda)
\end{gathered}
$$

Note that the electrical and field energy change equations represent a machine with a fixed air gap length (no mechanical energy changes). By integrating the equations we can calculate the stored magnetic field energy $W_f$ or the induced electrical energy $W_e$ of the machine.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	dW_f = (i)(d\lambda) \implies W_f = \int_{0}^{\lambda} i \, d\lambda\\
	(N)(i) = (H_c)(l_c) + (H_g)(l_g)\\
	\lambda = (N)(\Phi) = (N)(B)(A)\\
	W_f = \int \left(\frac{(H_c)(l_c) + (H_g)(l_g)}{N}\right) (N)(A) \, dB \\
	W_f = \int \left((H_c)(l_c) + \frac{(B)(l_g)}{\mu_0}\right) (A) \, dB \\
	W_f = \int \left((H_c)(l_c)(A)\,dB + \frac{(B)(l_g)}{\mu_0}(A)\,dB\right) \\
	W_f = \frac{B^2}{2\mu_0}((l_g)(A)) + \int \left((H_c\,dB)((l_c)(A)) \right)\\
	W_f = \frac{B^2}{2\mu_0}(V_g) + \left(\int (H_c\,dB_c)\right)(V_c)\\
	W_f = (w_{fc})(V_c) + (w_{fg})(V_g) = W_{fc} + W_{fg}\\
	w_{fc} = \text{ Energy Density In the Core}\\
	V_c = \text{ Core's Volume}\\
	W_{fc} = \text{ Energy In the Core}\\\\
	\text{Field Energy Stored}\\
	W_f = (w_{fc})(V_c) + (w_{fg})(V_g)
\end{gathered}
$$

Normally $W_{fc}$ can be neglected when compared to $W_{fg}$. If the flux linkage and current relation happens to be linear for a particular device then:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	H_c = \frac{B_c}{\mu_c}\\
	w_{fc} = \int \frac{(B_c)\,dB_c}{\mu_c} (B_c) = \frac{B_c^2}{2\mu_c}\\\\
	\text{Field Energy Density Approximation}\\
	w_{fc} = \frac{B_c^2}{2\mu_c}
\end{gathered}
$$

***

## Energy and CoEnergy ##

![Mechanical energy curves](/static/images/notes/MechanicalEnergyCurvesActuators.png)

We know that the linkage - current (magnetic to electric) relation is dependent on the air gap length and the particular magnetization curve of the material. We call co-energy to the area under the linkage - current curve, in other words to the integral of the linkage with respect to the current $W_f'$ instead of the integral of the current with respect to the linkage $W_f$.

The co-energy has no physical meaning but is useful when trying to determine the mechanical energy that the machine has developed:

$$
W_f' = \int_0^{i} \lambda \, di
$$

Again, if the flux linkage and current relation happens to be linear for a particular device then:

$$
W_f' = W_f = \lambda (i)
$$

![Quasistatic And Non Change](/static/images/notes/QuasiAndNonQuasiChangeActuators.png)

When calculating the mechanical energy output we must consider that the system can't be in static equilibrium, this means the length of the air gap will change through time. This change in air gap length will correspond to an additional change in linkage (with respect to time) however we can neglect the additional change in current (with respect to time) as long as the movement is quasistatic.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{During motion}\\
	dW_e = \int (e)(i)\,dt = \int_{\lambda 1}^{\lambda 2} (i)\,d\lambda = A_{abcd}\\
	dW_f = A_{0bc} - A_{0ad}\\
	dW_m = dW_e - dW_f\\
	dW_m = A_{abcd} + A_{0bc} - A_{0ad}\\\\
	\text{Mechanical Energy Output}\\
	dW_m = A_{0ab}
\end{gathered}
$$

Here is where the concept of co-energy is useful since the area between the two linkage - current curves is in fact equal to the change in co-energy. Once we have calculated the mechanical energy output we can then obtain the mechanical force $f_m$ that caused the corresponding change in air gap length (Quasistatic or Energy Method).

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Quasistatic Movement Force}\\
	dW_m = A_{0ab} = dW_f'\\
	(f_m)(dx) = dW_m = dW_f'\\
	f_m = \frac{dW_f'(i,x)}{dx}
\end{gathered}
$$

If on the contrary the movement is non-quasistatic from a quick change in air gap length then we might consider that the linkage remains constant therefore the mechanical energy output will come entirely from the the field energy stored, meaning that the mechanical work done can be represented as a simple decrease in the field's energy (Non-Quasistatic or CoEnergy Method).

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{NonQuasistatic Movement Force}\\
	dW_m = A_{0ap} = dW_f\\
	(f_m)(dx) = dW_m = -dW_f\\
	f_m = -\frac{dW_f(\lambda , x)}{dx}
\end{gathered}
$$

***

## Linear Systems ##

![Exercise of a Linear System](/static/images/notes/LinearSystemsFieldExerciseActuators.png)

If the mechanical force calculated from the energy and the co-energy is the same then the linkage - current relation is perfectly linear and the machine must be a linear actuator. When working with linear systems, as long as the core reluctance is negligible compared to its air gap reluctance then we can simplify the mechanical force equations by using the coil inductance equation:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\lambda = L(x)(i) \land W_f' = W_f\\ 
	W_f = \int (i)\, d\lambda = \int_{0}^{\lambda} \frac{\lambda}{L(x)} \, d\lambda\\
	W_f = \frac{\lambda^2}{(2)(L(x))}\\
	\text{Energy Method}\\
	f_m = -\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{\lambda^2}{(2)(L(x))}\right)\\
	f_m = \frac{\lambda^2}{(2)(L^2(x))} \frac{d(L(x))}{dx} = \frac{i^2}{2} \frac{d(L(x))}{dx}\\
	f_m = \frac{dW_f(i,x)}{dx}\\
	W_f = \frac{i^2(L(x))}{2}\\

	\text{Linear Mechanical Force}\\
	f_m = \frac{i^2}{2} \frac{d(L(x))}{dx}
\end{gathered}
$$

Furthermore if the core reluctance is neglected then:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	(N)(i) = (H_g)(2)(g) = \frac{B_g}{\mu_0}(2)(g)\\
	W_f = \frac{B_g^2}{(2)\mu_0}(2)(g)(A_g)\\
	f_m = \frac{d}{dg}\left( \frac{B_g^2}{(2)\mu_0}(2)(g)(A_g) \right)\\
	f_m = \frac{B_g^2}{(2)\mu_0}(2)(A_g)
\end{gathered}
$$

Since the cross sectional area of the gap in this case is $(2)(A_g)$ then the force per unit area of the air gap or *Magnetic Pressure* can be calculated as:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	F_m = \frac{B_g^2}{(2)\mu_0} \, N/m^2
\end{gathered}
$$

## Rotating Machines ##

![Rotator and Stator](/static/images/notes/RotatorStatorComponentsActuators.png)

The moving part in a rotating machine is called *Rotor* and the fixed part *Stator*. The rotor is mounted on a shaft between the ends of the stator. The simplest rotating machine would supply two independent paths, one to the rotor and one to the stator, using two independent coils, with the rotor coil using fixed brushes and rotor slip rings. Both currents are taken into account to calculate their corresponding stored field energy:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{ Static Equilibrium}\\
	dW_f = (e)(i_s) \,dt + (e)(i_r) \,dt\\
	dW_f = (i_s) \,d\lambda_s + (i_r) \,d\lambda_r
\end{gathered}
$$

As with linear systems we can use the coil inductance function $L(\theta)$ (this time in terms of the angle) to represent the rotor and stator linkage. This coil inductance function can be further subdivided into its self inductance ($L_{ss}(\theta)$ and $L_{rr}(\theta)$) and mutual inductance ($L_{ss}(\theta)$) components.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\lambda_s = L_{ss}(\theta)(i_s) + L_{sr}(\theta)(i_r)\\
	\lambda_r = L_{rs}(\theta)(i_s) + L_{rr}(\theta)(i_r)\\
	L_{sr} = L_{rs}\\
	dW_f = (i_s)d(L_{ss} i_s + L_{sr} i_r) + (i_r)d(L_{rs} i_s + L_{rr} i_r )\\
	dW_f = L_{ss} i_s  d(i_s) + L_{rr} i_r  d(i_r) + L_{sr} d(i_s i_r)\\
	W_f = L_{ss} \int_{0}^{i_s} (i_s)(di_s) + L_{rr} \int_{0}^{i_r} (i_r)(di_r) + L_{sr} \int_{0}^{i_s i_r} (di_s i_r)\\\\
	\text{Linear System Rotating Field Energy}\\
	W_f = W_f' = \frac{L_{ss} i_s^2 }{2} + \frac{L_{rr} i_r^2}{2} + L_{sr} i_s  i_r
\end{gathered}
$$

Just like the magnetic force we obtained from the stored field energy (with a constant current) we can also obtain the magnetic torque of the machine:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	T = \frac{dW_f'(i , \theta)}{d\theta}\\
	T = \frac{i_s^2}{2} \frac{d(L_{ss}(\theta))}{d\theta}  + \frac{i_r^2}{2} \frac{d(L_{rr}(\theta))}{d\theta} + i_s i_r \frac{d(L_{sr}(\theta))}{d\theta}
\end{gathered}
$$

Note that the first two terms of the last equation are the *Reluctance Torques* produced from the variation of the self inductance as a function of the rotor position (angle) while the last term is the *Mutual Inductance Torque* produced from the variation of their mutual inductance, also as a function of the rotor angle. Reluctance Torque can be produced naturally from the change in air gap length as the rotor rotates inside the stator.

![Mutually Perpendicular](/static/images/notes/InducedVoltageandForceVectorsActuators.png)

A motor transforms from electrical into mechanical energy, a generator transforms from mechanical into electrical energy, both use the stored magnetic field energy or coupling as their intermediary. The electric or mechanical force as a result of the field energy can be described in terms of the charges involved (Lorentz) or the conductors involved (Laplace).

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Lorentz's Law}\\
	f = (q)(E + v + B)\\
	\text{Laplace's Law}\\
	\vec{F} = (i)(\vec{l} \times \vec{B})\\\\
	\text{Lenz's Law}\\
	e = (B)(l)(v)\\\\
	\text{Lorentz Force}\\
	f = (B)(l)(i)
\end{gathered}
$$

The Lenz's law is used to describe the induced voltage from a conductor traveling at a certain velocity through a magnetic field (generator). The Lorentz force is used to describe the induced force from a conductor in a magnetic field with an applied current (motor). Note that in both cases the three vectors are mutually perpendicular to each other. If the rotor or stator are subjected to a time variable magnetic field then the core is generally laminated to decrease the energy losses due to the parasitic Eddy currents. 

![DC Machine Two poles](/static/images/notes/DiagramofTwoPoleActuators.png)

The rotor and stator carry windings placed around multiple slots, in a DC machine the rotor's winding constitutes the armature while the stator's winding generates the main field. The field's winding can be subdivided into field windings in series and in parallel (derivation or shunt windings). Note that the flux distribution on the air gap created by the field's winding will be symmetric with respect to the pole axis.

**Induced Voltage Rectification**

Based on how the windings interact we can classify rotating machines into DC, Induction, Synchronous or Step machines. In DC machines there is a small loss of force as the armature rotates between the field windings (interpolar range), this produces an alternating field and voltage on every armature winding. To rectify this we can use a mechanical commutator with a brush assembly or place an specialized rectifier circuit. 

![Two Pole DC Machine](/static/images/notes/SlipRingsandBrushesRectifyActuators.png)

If we consider the most basic Two-Pole DC machine using sliding rings and a stationary brush assembly we can observe that the induced voltage and the magnetic flux distribution in the air gap will alternate as the armature rotates inside the field. 

![Commutator Segments First](/static/images/notes/ActuatorsMultipleCommutationSegments.png)

If we replace the sliding rings by two independent commutation segments we will be able to invert the direction of the current (terminal B1 will always be connected to the positive brush) and maintain a positive voltage in the armature. Note that the induced voltage of the individual loops (a to b) will continue to alternate but the voltage between the final terminals (1 to 2) will remain positive (unidirectional).

![Commutator Segments](/static/images/notes/RotationofCommutationSegmentsAcuators.png)

The current will go to the armature through the brushes, the commutator segments will invert the current direction when the loop is in the interpolar region, finally the commutator segments will be touching the next group of brushes. To further rectify the signal we might increase the number of commutation segments with their associated armature or field windings to decrease the interpolar region.

![Turn and Winding](/static/images/notes/TurnCoilandWindingActuators.png)

All windings are formed from coils connected in series, however armature windings can be connected in a Lap or Wave configuration (based on the position of the brushes).

**Lap Winding Configuration**

![La Configuration](/static/images/notes/LapWindingInActuators.png)

In this winding configuration the coils are simply laid in series, the number of parallel conductor paths will be determined by the number of poles along the winding, so in a 4 pole machine there will be 4 parallel paths between the terminals. Here the number of brush positions is equal to the number of poles.

**Wave Winding Configuration**

![Wave Configuration](/static/images/notes/WaveWindingConfigActuators.png)

The most important thing about this configuration is that the number of parallel conductor paths is always two independent of the number of poles, however there could be two or more brush positions.

**Voltage and Torque in the Armature**

![Armatures Torque and Voltage](/static/images/notes/ActuatorsArmaturesTorqueAndVoltage.png)

Considering that a single loop (a to b) is made up from two conductors we can calculate the induced voltage as the loop rotates inside the stator's field:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Voltage in an Armature's Loop}\\
	e_t = (2)(B(\theta))(l)(\omega_m)(r)\\\\
	\text{Average Voltage in an Armature's Loop}\\
	e_{t avg} = (2)(B(\theta)_{avg})(l)(\omega_m)(r)
\end{gathered}
$$

Considering that $\Phi$ is the magnetic flux per pole and $A$ as the area per pole we can calculate the average field $B(\theta)_{avg}$ and average voltage $e_{t avg}$ in an Armature's Loop as:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	B(\theta)_{avg} = \frac{\Phi}{A} = \frac{(\Phi)(p)}{(2)(\pi)(r)(l)}\\
	e_{t avg} = \frac{(\Phi)(p)(\omega_m)}{\pi}
\end{gathered}
$$

The induced voltages of every single loop will contribute to the overall average voltage what will end up in the Armature's terminals ($E_a$ and $E_b$):
$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Average Voltage in the Armature's Terminals}\\
	E_a = \frac{(N)(e_{t avg})}{a} = \frac{(N)(p)(\Phi)(\omega_m)}{\pi (a)}\\
	E_a = (K_a)(\Phi)(\omega_m)\\
	a = \text{ Parallel Conductors per Loop}\\
	N = \text{ Loops in the Armature's winding}\\\\
	K_a = \frac{(N)(p)}{(\pi)(a)} = \frac{(Z)(p)}{(2)(\pi)(a)}\\
	K_a = \text{ Armature's Constant}\\
	Z = \text{ Conductors in the Armature's winding}
\end{gathered}
$$

Note that we can apply the Armature's terminals ($E_a$ and $E_b$) equations to motors and generators, in the first case it represents the electromotive force required and in the second the voltage generated.

Using the Lorentz force we can calculate the force developed in one of the two conductors (aa') or (bb') that constitute the individual loop (aa'b'b) of a winding, considering that the loop is between two adjacent poles and that it has been placed on the periphery of the armature.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Force in an Armature's Conductor}\\
	f_c = B(\theta)(l)(I_c)\\
	f_c = B(\theta)(l)(\frac{I_a}{a})\\
	I_c = \text{ Armature's conductor current}\\
	I_a = \text{ Armature's terminal current}\\\\
	\text{Armature's Currents Relation}\\
	I_c = \frac{I_a}{a}
\end{gathered}
$$

From this force we can calculate the average torque developed by the conductor and since every conductor will develop a torque in the same direction then every single one will contribute to the total average torque of the armature. 

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Torque in an Armature's Conductor}\\
	T_c = B(\theta)(l)(\frac{I_a}{a})(r)\\
	T_c = \frac{(\Phi)(p)(I_a)}{(2)(\pi)(a)}\\\\
	\text{Average Armature's Torque}\\
	T = (T_c)(2)(N)\\
	T = \frac{(N)(\Phi)(p)(I_a)}{(\pi)(a)}\\
	T = (K_a)(\Phi)(I_a)
\end{gathered}
$$

Note that in an ideal motor the electrical input power must equal the mechanical power generated.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Input and Output Power}\\
	P_i = (E_a)(I_a) = (K_a)(\Phi)(I_a)(\omega_m) = (T)(\omega_m) = P_o
\end{gathered}
$$

The last power relationship is fundamental when characterizing a particular motor or generator from its Torque - Velocity curve.

![Equivalent Magnetic Circuit](/static/images/notes/EquivalentMagneticCircuitForArmatureActuators.png)

Since we can describe a DC machine from the interaction of its field and armature windings therefore we can also describe it using two equivalent magnetic circuits. The magnetic flux or circuit's field current will depend on the magnetomotive force through each pole ($F_p = Fmm$) generated by their field windings, the rest of the path will consist of magnetic reluctances.

Usually the magnetic flux path will be through a pole, the air gap, the slots, the core, the slots, the air gap, the opposite pole and the yoke back into the original pole. If the machine has a relatively low magnetic flux we can assume infinite permeability on every reluctance except the air gaps and therefore the magnetic flux per pole will be:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Magnetic Flux Per Pole}\\
	\Phi = \frac{F_p}{\Re_g}
\end{gathered}
$$

If the field current and therefore the flux increases then some parts in the magnetic circuit will saturate slowing down the flux - Fp curve, starting with the slots of the rotor. Using the magnetic circuit model it is more common to represent the magnetization curve as the induced armature voltage with respect to the field current or electromotive force for a particular armature velocity.

**Machine Classification**

![Magnetic Circuit Configurations](/static/images/notes/ShuntandWindingConfigurationsActuators.png)

The magnetic circuit model can also be applied to represent the different winding configurations including the separated excitation, in series, and in parallel (shunt).

* Separate Excitation: Higher number of loops and a lower current. The voltage in the terminals is almost independent of the load on the machine since it can be regulated from the rheostat within the saturation limits of the field circuit.
* In series DC: Lower number of loops and a higher current, the winding must have a higher caliber to sustain the additional current. The magnetic flux will be proportional to the current through the armature. The main advantage is that it has a high starting torque and is resistant to extreme loads since the armature response will be to simply lower its speed, the main disadvantage is that it can only be excited while in movement. IN CONSLUSION it can deliver high torques but the speed must be controled by controling the armature resistance.
* In parallel DC (shunt): The field and armature circuits are connected in parallel. It supplies a constant voltage independent of the load as long as the load changes are small, the main advantage is that it self regulates and mantains a contant voltage even as the load changes, this is ideal for generators but the main disadvantage is thaty depending on the conditions they might need backup generators or batteries to compansate an unexpented change in the load. CONSLUSION With a constante field current we can achieve a constant velocity wich can be controled easily in a wide range of velocities.
* Compound in parallel DC: It combines a series and parallel configuration meaning that it can achieve a stable torque in a wide speed range, the main disadvantage is that it cant be used to charge bateries. CONSLUSION has both characteristics, for example the one in series could be condiered a similar series version but with a limited range of velocities in the empty space.

**Separate Excitation in Generator**

![Separate Excitation](/static/images/notes/)

A DC generator is coupled to a constant velocity system and the armature terminals are connected to an electric load. In this case the field winding will be excited by an external DC source, in ideal conditions the inductor will beheave as a short circuit meaning that its voltage will be zero.

R_{fw} is the field circuit winding resistance
R_{fc} is the field circuit control resistance
R_f = R_{fw} + R_{fc} is the total field circuit resistance
R_a is the armature circuit (including brushes) resistance
R_L is the generator load resistance

If the generator is in a stable state, meaning that the field and armature inductances can be neglected, then the following is true:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	V_f = R_f I_f\\
	E_a = V_t + I_a R_a\\
	E_a = K_a \Phi \omega_m\\
	V_t = I_t R_L\\
	I_a = I_t\\
	V_t = E_a - R_a I_a
\end{gathered}
$$

**Armature Reaction (AR)**

Just like the armature circuit resistance lowers the output voltage given by the armature in a generator there will also be an armature response demagnetization effect that will lower even more the supplied voltage as the required load current increases.

If there is no current in the armature all the magnetic flux will come from the field circuit current, however if there is some current due to the naturally induce voltage in the armature then it will produce its own magnetomotive force, one half of this additional flux will oppose force of one pole and the other will increment the force of the opposite pole. 

This effect should therefore cancel out, however at high currents and high voltages the additional flux density cause magnetic saturation in the circuit resulting in a reduction in the flux of one of the poles.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{No load}\\
	I_a = I_t = 0\\
	V_{t0} = E_{a0}\\
	\text{With load}\\
	E_a = V_t + I_a R_a\\
\end{gathered}
$$

We can see that E_a is reduced byu the presence of AR
The effect of AR is a reduction in the effective field current applied.

The difference betwen the real and effective field current is considered the armature reaction current or demagnetization current:

I_feff = Ifreal - IfAR



**Compensating Windings**

To compensate fot the effects of armature reaction we can use another compensating winding in series with the armature, this additional coils will be inserted inside slots in the poles and will produce an magnetomotive force that counteracts the effect of the armature. Compensating windings aren't common since they add an additional cost and complexity to the manufacturing of the generator.




**Self Excitation in Generator**

![Self Excitation](/static/images/notes/)

After the armature is turning with a certain velocity we turn off the field circuit. A small voltage $E_{ar}$ appears in the armature terminals from residual magnetism. We reconnect the field circuit to the armature circuit, a current $F_p$ flows in the field winding increasing the residual magnetism and the field current $I_{f1}$. 

From the field current $I_{f1}$ a new induced voltage $E_{a1}$ will be generated in the armature with a value on its terminals of $V_t = I_f R_f \lt E_{a1}$. The induced voltage will eventually increase the field current $I_{f2}$ therefore increasing the induced voltage $E_{a2}$. This process repeats increasing the field current and the induced voltage along the magnetization curve.

If we neglect the voltage of $R_a$ then the induced voltage increase will increase to $P$ the maximum value given by the magnetization curve and the resistance line of the field where $E_a = If R_f = V_t$, from this point there is no more residual voltage left to increase the field current.

Note that if the resistance line slope is higher than $R_{f3}, also called the critical field circuit resistance, then we won't be able to self excite the circuit. Lower resistance line values will allow the generator to self excite into higher voltages. 

1. For self excitation to work there must be some residual magnetism.
2. The winding field force must be present to increase the residual magnetism.
3. The field circuit resistance line must be lower than the critical resistance.
