# Introduction #

* Mechatronic System: Measures signals, process them and generates an action through actuators or motion. 
	* Structure: Body of the system, how we integrate components.
	* Sensors: Devices that detect physical magnitudes and transform them to electrical signals.
	* Actuators: Devices that perform actions in response to signals.
	* Controllers: Regulate actuator response time and logic.
	* Interface: Devices that allow two or more systems to interact.

**Control System**

![Control System Example](/static/images/notes/ControlSystemExample.png)

Interconnection of components in a configuration that gives the desire response or *output signal* with respect to the reference *input signal* we have selected. In the most abstract sense control systems allow us to detect a variable and execute the actions needed to modify its value to the values we want. We can find control systems in most systems, for example in animals, machines or businesses. 

**Open Loop Control System**

Here the output generated depends directly on the input, meaning that we don't compare the controlled output with the reference signal. There is an expected signal input, an element of control, an element of correction, a process and a controlled variable output.

![Open Loop System](/static/images/notes/OpenLoopControlSystem.png)

For example a manual valve. Here the water flow is the input, the valve position is the element of control, the water level in a tank can be the element of correction, the water filling the tank is the process and maintaining the tank full of water is the controlled variable output.

![Open Loop System Example](/static/images/notes/OpenLoopControlSystemExample.png)

**Closed Loop of Feedback Control System**

Here the output generated depends on the input and the corrections performed by the feedback signal, meaning that we compare the controlled output with the reference signal.

There is a reference input that is compared with the feedback signal from a sensor, from this comparison comes an error signal that the controller uses to act on the system via actuators, the actuators change the output signal closer to the reference. The cycle repeats when the sensor takes another measurement of the output.

![Open Loop System](/static/images/notes/ClosedLoopControlSystem.png)

For example in a heating system the expected temperature is set in a thermostat as a reference or set point, a sensor compares this reference with the measured temperature of the room, the difference or error signal is used by the controller to modify the valves of a gas furnace via actuators, this generates a feedback signal in the form of new heat that in turn changes the overall temperature or output signal. The cycle repeats as the sensor takes another measurement of the new output.

**Actuator**

Device that transforms energy to a desired motion or action. Its *Driving System* are the elements in the control system that translate the controller's output to a usable signal by the device.

**Mechanic System Components**

1. Actuators: Solenoids, DC Motors, Stepped Motors, Servomotors, Hydraulic, Pneumatic.
2. Sensors: Interrupters, Potentiometers, Photoelectric, Digital Position Encoder, Calibration Device, Thermocouple, Accelerometer, MEM
3. Input Signal Conditioning: Discrete Circuits, Amplifiers, Filters, Converters and Transformers
4. Control Architectures: Logic Circuits, Microcontrollers, PLC, Control Algorithms
5. Output Signal Conditioning: Amplifiers, Transistors, Op-Amps
6. Interfaces: LED, Digital Screens, LCD, CRT

**Classification**

1. Hydraulic: Transform the energy of compressed air to mechanic work such as linear or circular motion. A lot of power from little applied force. 
2. Pneumatic: Transform the energy of fluid pressure (generally mineral fluid) to mechanic work. A lot of power from little applied force. 
3. Electric: Transform electrical energy to mechanic work such as linear or circular motion. Lower torque but faster and more precise movements.

# Electromagnetic Actuators #

![Linear and Rotational Example](/static/images/notes/LinearandRotationalActuators.png)

Can be classified into *Linear*, for example a solenoid valve, or *Rotational*, for example an electric motor. They are made from magnetic circuits with ferromagnetic or magnetic materials that shape and direct the magnetic fields (electromagnetic energy) created. The magnetic fields are used as a medium to convert electrical energy into mechanical energy.

Permanent magnets help create the high flux density needed for a large torque. A layer of air or air gap is also commonly used in rotating machines. In most electrical machines (except permanent magnet machines) the magnetic field is produced by a current passing through coils wound on a ferromagnetic material.

## Electromagnetic Relations ###

**i-H Relation**

![Relationship Magnetic Actuators](/static/images/notes/iHRelationActuators.png)

There is a relation between the current in a conductor and the magnetic field intensity it creates around it. First the direction of the flux lines can be determined by the *right hand rule*. The relation can be derived from *Ampere's Circuit Law* finally stating that the line integral of the magnetic field intensity (H) around any closed path when taking incremental steps (dl) is equal to the total current linked by the contour. 

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Ampere's Law}\\
	\oint \vec{B} \, \vec{dl} = (\mu_0)(i)\\\\
	\oint H \, dl \, \cos(\theta) = \sum i\\
	\text{Circle with one current}\\
	\oint H \, dl = i \implies H \oint dl = i\\
	(H)(2 \pi r) = i \implies H = \frac{i}{2 \pi r}
\end{gathered}
$$

Applying the i-H relation to a simple linear conductor carrying a current and using a circle as our contour (dl is the same as H) we can see that:

1. From symmetry H will be the same at every point along the contour
2. H is inversely proportional to the radius r to the conductor.
3. H is proportional to the current passing through the conductor.

**B-H Relation**

$$
\begin{gathered}
	B = (\mu)(H) \, \text{T}\\
	\mu = (\mu_0)(\mu_r) \, \text{H/m}\\
	\mu_0 = 1.256637062 \times 10^{-6}
\end{gathered}
$$

The magnetic field intensity (H) produces a magnetic flux density (B) that saturates the medium where the flux line pass through. Permeability is similar to conductivity since it relates to how easily the magnetic field can pass through a medium. In ferromagnetic materials such as iron, cobalt and nickel the relative permeability varies from 100's to 1000's but for electric machines the value typically ranges from 2000 to 6000. We can see that:

1. A high H will produce a high B through the medium.
2. A high permeability implies a large B from a small current.

**Solenoid Field**

![Solenoid Field](/static/images/notes/SolenoidFieldActuators.png)

Arranging conductors in turns and forming a coil is how we generate a uniform magnetic field, we call this arrangement a solenoid. As we form turns with the conductor and the solenoid increases in length we can see from its electromagnetic symmetry that the flux lines cancel each other out until we only have the lines parallel to the solenoid's length remaining. Every single horizontal line inside the solenoid gets amplified by the sum of each individual conductor resulting in greater flux density. 

![Ideal Solenoid Field](/static/images/notes/IdealSolenoidActuators.png)

If the solenoid is ideal (infinitely large) the outside horizontal lines go in opposite directions canceling each other out, furthermore even if the solenoid isn't infinite the density of the outside flux lines is still negligible since their magnetic loop covers a greater volume. Using an ideal solenoid and applying Ampere's Law to any contour (for example a rectangle) where the current passes through gets us the solenoid field equation:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\oint B \, dl = \int_a^b B \, dl + \int_b^c B \, dl + \int_c^d B \, dl + \int_d^a B \, dl\\
	\int_a^b B (0) = 0 \land  \int_c^d B \, (0) = 0\\
	\int_d^a B \, dl = 0 \text{ from an ideal solenoid}\\
	\therefore \oint B \, dl = \int_b^c B \, dl\\
	\text{Closed current in the rectangle}\\
	\sum i = i = (i_0)(n)(l)\\
	i_0 = \text{ Applied current}\\
	\text{Applying Ampere's Law}
	\oint \vec{B} \, \vec{dl} = (\mu_0)(i)\\
	(B)(l) = (\mu_0)((i_0)(n)(l))\\
	\therefore B = (\mu_0)(i_0)(n)\\
	n = \text{ Turns per unit of length}
\end{gathered}
$$

This equation states that the field inside an ideal solenoid doesn't depend on the radius of the turns or the length of the conductor but instead on the current applied and the total number of turns per unit of length. We can see that:

1. We can increase B in a solenoid by increasing the applied current or the number of turns in the same length.

**Exercise**

A solenoid of length 0.6m has three layers of turns each with 500 turns. Calculate the magnetic field density inside the solenoid if we apply a 2A current.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	B = \mu_0 \frac{n i_0}{l} \\
	B = (1.256637062 \times 10^{-6})\frac{(1500)(2)}{0.6} = 0.006283 T
\end{gathered}
$$

## Magnetic Equivalent Circuit ##

IMAGEN TOROIDE

We can make a simple magnetic circuit by putting a solenoid around a toroid core and just like before most of the flux density will be contained inside its core. This is almost the same case as the solenoid field equation with the only difference that the length will be the circumference of the toroid $l = 2\pi r$ .

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\oint \vec{H} \, \vec{dl} = (N)(i)\\
	H (2 \pi r) = H(l) = (N)(i) = F\\
	F = \text{ Magnetomotive Force mmf}\\
	\therefore H = \frac{(N)(i)}{l} \, \text{tA/m}\\
	B = (\mu)(H) \, \text{T}\\
	\therefore B = (\mu)\frac{(N)(i)}{l} \, \text{T}
\end{gathered}
$$

Note that since we are using a ferromagnetic core for the toroid $\mu$ will have a relative value. Now that we know the magnetic field intensity inside the toroid we can calculate how much flux is flowing $\Phi$ through a cross section.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\Phi = \int B \, dA\\
	\Phi = (B)(A) \, \text{wb}\\
	B = (\mu)\frac{(N)(i)}{l} \, \text{T}\\
	\Phi = (\mu)\frac{(N)(i)(A)}{l}\\
	\Phi = \frac{(N)(i)}{\frac{l}{(\mu)(A)}}\\
	\Phi = \frac{(N)(i)}{\Re}\\
	\Re = \frac{l}{(\mu)(A)} = \frac{1}{P}\\
	\Re = \text{ Magnetic Path Reluctance}\\
	P = \text{ Magnetic Path Permeance}
\end{gathered}
$$

IMAGEN CIRCUITO EQUIVALENTE

From this properties we can work with magnetic circuits using equivalent electrical circuits by equating the Magnetomotive Force $F$ to the Electromotive Force $E$ , the Flux flow $\Phi = \frac{F}{\Re}$ to the Current $i = \frac{E}{R}$ and the Magnetic Path Reluctance $\Re = \frac{l}{(\mu)(A)}$ to the Resistance $R = \frac{l}{(\sigma)(A)}$ .

IMAGEN CURVAS MAGNETIZACION

The magnetization curve of a material represents how as we increase the magnetic intensity by driving a higher current the magnetic density also increases. The relation will remain linear for low intensity values but at high intensities it will reach a point of saturation. Note that the circuit's reluctance depends mostly on the density meaning that the higher the density the higher the reluctance. The magnetization curve will depend on the ferromagnetic core used, therefore in order to achieve the required level of flux density you might need different current values.

## Air Gap ##

IMAGEN DE LA MAQUINA ROTACIONAL CON AIR GAP

In rotating machines.The rotor is physically isolated from the stator by an air gap.

The same flux is present in the poles (magnetic core) and the ari gap, to mantain the same flux density the air gap requires much more F than the core. 

If the B is high the core of the circuit might exibit saturation, but the air gap will remain unsaturated since the magnetization curve of the air is linear (since mu is constant). 

For Analysis we can still use an equivalent magnetic circuit where we cave to distinct reluctances, one for the core and one for the air gap.

# Electric Machines #

## Magnetic Circuits ##

* Study of the devices used to transform between electrical and mechanical energy.
* The most common machines used are rotating machines like DC, induction or synchronous.
* Transformers aren't electromechanical converters but play an important role.
* Actuators, solenoids and releays are examples of linear motion machines.
* These devices use magnetic materials to direct the magnetic fields that act as an energy medium.
* These materials also generate a high magnetic field density (flux) translating into a large motion output.

**Magnetic Circuits**

Formed by ferromagnetic materials only (transformers) or ferromagnetic materials with an air gap (rotating machines). The magnetic field (flux) is produced by an electrical current passing through coils wound on the ferromagnetic material, except on permanent magnet machines.

**i-H Relation**

There is a relation between the current in a coil and the magnetic field intensity (flux or H) it produces.

The *direction* of the flux lines can be determined by the thumb rule, meaning that if the current (i) travels in the direction of the thumb then the flux lines follow the direction of the rest of the fingers.

This relation can be obtained using *Amphere's circuit law*. This law states that the line integral of $H$ arround a closed path is equal to the total current in the contour. 

Here $H$ is the magnetic field intensity at a countour point, $dl$ is the incremental length at that point. Notice that there *could* be an angle between the vectors $H$ and $dl$ called $\theta$.

Assuming the current travels through an ideal conductor we can simplify the countour to a circle meaning that we can obtain $H$ at a distance $r$ from the conductor. Here there is no $\theta$ since $H$ and $dl$ follow the same direction.
