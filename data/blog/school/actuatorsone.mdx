# Introduction #

Mechatronic System: Measures signals, processes them and generates an action through actuators. 

1. Structure: Body of the system, how we integrate components.
2. Sensors: Devices that detect physical magnitudes and transforms them to signals.
3. Actuators: Devices that perform actions in response to signals.
4. Controllers: Regulate actuators response time and logic.
5. Interface: Devices that allow two or more systems to interact.

**Mechatronic System Components**

1. Actuators: Solenoid, DC Motor, Stepper Motor, Servomotor, Hydraulic, Pneumatic.
2. Sensors: Interrupter, Potentiometer, Photoelectric, Encoder, Thermocouple, Accelerometer, MEM.
3. Input Signal Conditioning: Discrete Circuits, Amplifiers, Filters, Converters, Transformers.
4. Control Architectures: Logic Circuits, Microcontrollers, PLC, Control Algorithms.
5. Output Signal Conditioning: Amplifiers, Transistors, Op-Amps.
6. Interfaces: LED, Digital Screens, LCD, CRT.

**Control System**

![Control System Example](/static/images/notes/ControlSystemExample.png)

Interconnection of components in a configuration that gives you the desired response or *output signal* with respect to the reference *input signal* we have selected. Control systems allow us to detect a variable and then execute the actions needed to modify its value into the range of values we want. We can find control systems on most systems, for example in animals, machines or businesses. 

**Open Loop Control System**

![Open Loop System](/static/images/notes/OpenLoopControlSystem.png)

Here the output generated depends directly on the input, meaning that we don't compare the controlled output with the reference signal.

![Open Loop System Example](/static/images/notes/OpenLoopControlSystemExample.png)

For example a simple valve. Here the water flow is the input, the valve's position is the element of control, water level in the tank can be the element of correction, filling the tank is the process and maintaining the tank at a certain level is the controlled variable output.

**Closed Loop of Feedback Control System**

![Open Loop System](/static/images/notes/ClosedLoopControlSystem.png)

Here the output generated depends on the input and the corrections performed by the feedback signal, meaning that we compare the controlled output with the reference signal. The difference between the feedback and the input is the error signal used by the controller to drive the actuators needed to change the output closer to the reference. The cycle repeats when the sensor takes additional measurements.

![Open Loop System Example](/static/images/notes/ClosedLoopControlSystemExample.png)

For example, in a heating system the expected temperature is set in a thermostat as a reference or set point, a sensor measures the temperature output and compares it with the reference, their error is then used by the controller to modify the valves of a gas furnace, this generates a feedback signal in the form of new heat that in turn changes output. The cycle repeats as the sensor takes another measurement.

**Actuator**

A device that transforms energy to a desired motion or action, the control system *drives* the actuator by translating the controller's output into a usable signal.

**Actuator Classification**

1. Pneumatic: Transforms the energy of compressed air into to work like linear or circular motion. High power output from low applied force. 
2. Hydraulic: Transforms the energy of incompressible fluids, generally mineral oil, into work. Highest power output from low applied force. 
3. Electric: Transforms electrical energy into mechanical work. Lower overall torque but faster and more precise movements.

**Magnetic Field Concepts**

* Magnetic field $B$: Field that influences moving charges, electric currents and magnetic materials by inducing magnetic forces.
* Magnetic field intensity or strength $H$: Amount of magnetizing force in space. Measured in ampere per meter.
* Magnetic flux density $B$: Amount of magnetic force induced on a body due to a magnetizing force. Measured in tesla.
* Magnetic flux $\Phi$: Surface integral of the flux lines over a surface. Measured in weber.
* Magnetization $M$: Capability of a particular magnetic field strength to increase the magnetic flux density of a material.
* Magnetomotive Force $mmf$: Magnetic force that drives the motion of the magnetic flux through a body.

# Electromagnetic Actuators #

![Linear and Rotational Example](/static/images/notes/LinearandRotationalActuators.png)

Electromagnetic actuators an be classified into *Linear*, for example a solenoid valve, or *Rotational*, for example an electric motor. They are made from magnetic circuits with ferromagnetic or magnetic materials that shape and direct magnetic fields. The magnetic fields are used as a medium (electromagnetic energy) to convert from electrical energy into mechanical energy.

Permanent magnets and a layer of air in rotating machines help maintain the high flux needed to create a large torque. In most electrical machines (except permanent magnet machines) the magnetic flux is produced simply by driving a current through coils wound around a ferromagnetic core.

***

## Electromagnetic Relations ###

**i-H Relation**

![Relationship Magnetic Actuators](/static/images/notes/iHRelationActuators.png)

There is a direct relation between the current in a conductor and the magnetic field strength around it. First the direction of the flux lines can be determined by the *right hand rule*. The relation can be derived from *Ampere's Circuit Law*, stating that the line integral of the magnetic field $B$ around any closed path, when taking incremental steps $dl$, is equal to the total current $i$ linked by the contour times the medium's permeability $\mu_0$.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Ampere's Law}\\
	\oint \vec{B} \, \vec{dl} = (\mu_0)(i)\\\\
	\oint \vec{H} \, \vec{dl} \, \cos(\theta) = \sum i\\\\
	\text{Circle with one current}\\
	\oint H \, dl = i \implies H \oint dl = i\\
	(H)(2 \pi r) = i \implies H = \frac{i}{2 \pi r}
\end{gathered}
$$

By relating the magnetic field strength that surrounds a conductor to its current we can see that:

1. H will be the same at every point along the contour (magnetic field symmetry).
2. H is proportional to the current passing through the conductor.
2. H is inversely proportional to the radius of the contour.

**B-H Relation**

As H increases so does the magnetic flux density $B$. Permeability $\mu$ represents how easily the flux lines can pass through the medium before reaching its saturation point. In ferromagnetic materials such as iron, cobalt and nickel their relative permeability $mu_r$ varies from 100's to 1000's, for electric machines the value typically ranges from 2000 to 6000. We can see that:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	B = (\mu)(H) \, \text{T}\\
	\mu = (\mu_0)(\mu_r) \, \text{H/m}\\
	\mu_0 = 1.256637062 \times 10^{-6}
\end{gathered}
$$


1. A high $H$ will produce a high $B$ through the medium.
2. A high $\mu$ implies that a large $B$ will be obtained from a small current.

**Solenoid Field**

![Solenoid Field](/static/images/notes/SolenoidFieldActuators.png)

When we arrange a conductor into a coil we generate a uniform magnetic field, we call this arrangement a solenoid. As the solenoid increases in length we can see from its electromagnetic symmetry that the flux lines cancel each other out until the only lines remaining are the ones parallel to the solenoid's length. Every single horizontal line inside the solenoid gets amplified by the sum of the individual conductor loops flux lines therefore greatly increasing the overall flux density. 

![Ideal Solenoid Field](/static/images/notes/IdealSolenoidActuators.png)

If we consider an ideal solenoid (infinitely large) then the outside horizontal lines go in opposite directions canceling each other out, furthermore even if the solenoid isn't infinite the density of the outside flux lines is still negligible since their magnetic loop around the solenoid covers a far greater volume. Using an ideal solenoid and applying Ampere's Law to any contour, for example a rectangle where the current passes through gets us the solenoid field equations:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\oint B \, dl = \int_a^b B \, dl + \int_b^c B \, dl + \int_c^d B \, dl + \int_d^a B \, dl\\
	\int_a^b B (0) = 0 \land  \int_c^d B \, (0) = 0\\
	\int_d^a B \, dl = 0 \text{ (ideal solenoid)}\\
	\oint B \, dl = \int_b^c B \, dl\\
	\text{Closed current in the rectangle}\\
	\sum i = i = (i_0)(n)(l)\\
	i_0 = \text{ Applied current}\\
	\text{Ampere's Circuit Law}\\
	\oint \vec{B} \, \vec{dl} = (\mu_0)(i)\\
	(B)(l) = (\mu_0)((i_0)(n))\\
	\therefore B = (\mu_0)(i_0)(n)\\
	n = \text{ Turns per unit of length}
\end{gathered}
$$

This equation states that the flux density inside an ideal solenoid doesn't depend on the radius to the conductor or its overall length just on the current applied and the total number of turns per unit of length. We can see that:

1. To increase the $B$ in a solenoid we can increase the applied current or the number of turns by unit of length.

***

## Magnetic Equivalent Circuit ##

![Toroid Only](/static/images/notes/CreatingAToroidActuators.png)

A magnetic circuit can be made by looping a solenoid around a ferromagnetic toroid where most of the flux density will remain inside solenoid's core.  Here the solenoid field equation remains almost the same with the only addition that this time the unit of length instead of being the length of the solenoid will be the circumference of the toroid $l = 2\pi r$.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Solenoid Field}
	\oint \vec{B} \, \vec{dl} = (\mu)(n)(i) \land n = \frac{N}{l}\\
	B = (\mu)(H) \implies \oint \vec{H} \, \vec{dl} = (N)(i)\\
	H (2 \pi r) = (H)(l) = (N)(i) = F\\
	F = \text{ Magnetomotive Force mmf}\\
	\therefore H = \frac{(N)(i)}{l} \, \text{At/m} \land B = (\mu)\frac{(N)(i)}{l} \, \text{T}
\end{gathered}
$$

Since we are using a ferromagnetic core $\mu$ must have a relative value to vacuum. Now that we know the $H$ inside the toroid we can calculate how much flux $\Phi$ there is at any cross sectional area of the core.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\Phi = \int B \, dA = (B)(A) \, \text{Wb}\\
	B = (\mu)\frac{(N)(i)}{l} \, \text{T} \implies \Phi = (\mu)\frac{(N)(i)(A)}{l}\\
	\Phi = \frac{(N)(i)}{\frac{l}{(\mu)(A)}} = \frac{(N)(i)}{\Re} \, \text{Wb}\\
	\Re = \frac{l}{(\mu)(A)} = \frac{1}{P}\\
	\Re = \text{ Magnetic Path Reluctance}\\
	P = \text{ Magnetic Path Permeance}
\end{gathered}
$$

![Equivalent Magnetic Circuit](/static/images/notes/EquivalentMagneticCircuitInActuators.png)

We can use our knowledge of electric circuits with this magnetic circuit by equating the Magnetomotive Force $F$ to the Electromotive Force $E$ , the Flux flow $\Phi = \frac{F}{\Re}$ to the Current $i = \frac{E}{R}$ and the Magnetic Path Reluctance $\Re = \frac{l}{(\mu)(A)}$ to the Resistance $R = \frac{l}{(\sigma)(A)}$. The main difference being that the in a magnetic circuit the power dissipation is not associated with reluctance.

![Magnetization Curve](/static/images/notes/MagnetizationCurvesInActuators.png)

The magnetization curve represents how much $B$ will increase inside the material as we increase $H$, for example by driving a higher current. This relation is linear for low $H$ values but at some point it will reach the material's saturation region. Note that the linear region is characterized by a low reluctance and the saturation region by a high reluctance. We can see that:

1. For different materials you will need a different to achieve the same magnetic flux density.

***

## Magnetic Circuit with Air Gap ##

![Rotational Machine](/static/images/notes/RotationalMachineWithEquivalentActuators.png)

In rotating machines we leave an air gap between the core (rotor) and the solenoid (stator). This air gap is necessary to maintain a *frictionless* rotation of the motor shaft, in small motors is as small as it can get to reduce electromagnetic energy losses but on larger motors we increase its size to protect the rotor form being pulled into contact with the stator.

A disadvantage of the air gap is that it introduces a higher $F$ requirement to maintain the same flux density in the inside of the solenoid, however it also allows for the core to be completely saturated in a safely manner since the air will remain unsaturated. To account for the air gap we introduce an additional reluctance to the equivalent magnetic circuit .

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\Re_c = \frac{l_c}{(\mu_c)(A_c)}\\
	\Re_g = \frac{l_g}{(\mu_0)(A_g)}\\
	\Phi = \frac{(N)(i)}{\Re} = \frac{(N)(i)}{\Re_c + \Re_g}\\
	(N)(i) = (H_c)(l_c) + (H_g)(l_g)\\ 
	l_c = \text{ Core length} \land l_g = \text{ Air Gap length}\\
	\Phi = (B)(A) \implies B_c = \frac{\Phi_c}{A_c} \land B_g = \frac{\Phi_g}{A_g}
\end{gathered}
$$

Note: Since the air gap isn't contained inside a solenoid, flux lines start to bulge outwards when magnetizing the core, this is known as the fringing effect. To account for it we increase the cross sectional area of the air gap *capturing* the additional flux lines. Most of the time, if the air gap is small, the fringing effect can be neglected and the cross sectional areas remain equal.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{By neglecting the fringing effect}\\
	A_c = A_g = A \land B_c = B_g = \frac{\Phi}{A}
\end{gathered}
$$

***

## Magnetic Circuit Inductance ##

The coil used in a magnetic circuit may be thought as an inductor, here inductance is defined as the *Magnetic Flux Linkage* $\lambda$ per Ampere of current:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\lambda = (N)(\Phi) \, \text{Wb t}\\
	L = \frac{\lambda}{i} = \frac{(N)(\Phi)}{i} = \frac{(N)(B)(A)}{i} = \frac{(N)(\mu)(H)(A)}{i}\\
	L = \frac{(N)(\mu)(H)(A)}{\frac{H(l)}{N}} = \frac{(\mu)(A)(N)^2}{l} = \frac{N^2}{\Re}
\end{gathered}
$$

***

## Hysteresis ##

![Hysteresis Curves](/static/images/notes/HysteresisCurvesMagnetActuators.png)

Magnetic hysteresis, from the Greek word of *being late*, means that the magnetic material will retain the magnetic flux (residual) acquired through the increase of the magnetic field strength. Once magnetized the opposing magnetic field strength needed to demagnetize the material is called the coercivity or coercive force. 

Depending on the material, the current and the current magnetic saturation you can form hysteresis of different shapes and sizes, in practice the bigger the hysteresis the lower the current you need to keep the core magnetized, however it will also lower the overall response time of the actuator.

**Sinusoidal Excitation**

![Sinusoidal Excitation](/static/images/notes/SinusoidalExitationActuators.png)

When you apply an AC voltage source to a magnetic circuit it will produce a sinusoidal excitation, being an inductor we will see a phase angle between the induced voltage and the magnetic flux of the circuit. The relation between the induced voltage and the magnetic flux is determined by Faraday's Law.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\Phi(t) = \Phi_{max}(\sin(\omega (t)))\\
	\Phi_{max}  = \text{ Core flux amplitude}\\
	\omega  = \text{ Angular frequency} = 2\pi f\\
	\text{Applying Faraday's Law}\\
	e(t) = N\frac{d\Phi}{dt}\\
	e(t) = N(\Phi)(\omega)(\cos(\omega (t)))\\
	e(t) = E_{max}(\cos(\omega (t)))\\
	E_{rms} = \frac{E_max}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{N\Phi_{max} \omega}{\sqrt{2}} = 4.44Nf\phi_{max}
\end{gathered}
$$

**Permanent Magnet**

![Permanent Magnet](/static/images/notes/PermanentMagnetHysteresisCurveActuators.png)

By introducing a material with a high hysteresis into the magnetic circuit we can create a permanent magnet. The permanent magnet will maintain the magnetic flux required for the application with little to none additional current, they are made from iron, nickel and cobalt and usually called *hard iron* while the rest of the unmagnetized core is called *soft iron*. 

We start by magnetizing the hard iron with a positive magnetic field strength, after we remove the current the permanent magnet will retain its maximum magnetic flux, we call this the operating point of the permanent magnet. 

**Magnetization**

By applying a reversed magnetic field strength we can adjust the operating point of the magnet. From the operating point in the hysteresis loop and the presence or absence of the keeper the magnetic flux will be confined to the recoil line between the operating point and the vertical axis. Note that removing the keeper makes the air gap the active magnetic field region of the circuit. Assuming no leakage, no fringing and no soft iron reluctance:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	(H_m)(l_m) + (H_g)(l_g) = 0\\
	H_g = (H_m)\frac{-l_m}{l_g}\\
	\Phi = (B_m)(A_m) = (B_g)(A_g)\\
	B_m = \frac{(A_g)(B_g)}{(A_m)}\\
	B_g = (\mu_0)(H_g)\\
	\therefore B_m = -\frac{(\mu_0)(A_g)(l_m)(H_m)}{(A_m)(l_g)}
\end{gathered}
$$

![Shear Line](/static/images/notes/ShearLineImageDemagnetizeActuators.png)

This equation represents a straight line through the origin called the *shear line*. The intersection of the shear line with the demagnetization curve determines the new operating values $B$ and $H$ of the hard iron (with no keeper in the air gap). If the keeper is reinserted the operating point moves up the recoil line $bc$. This indicates that the operating point of a permanent magnet can be adjusted by adjusting the shear line.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	V_m = (A_m)(l_m)\\
	V_m = \frac{(B_g)(A_g)(H_g)(l_g)}{(B_m)(H_m)}\\
	V_m = \frac{(B_g)^2(V_g)}{(\mu_0)(B_m)(H_m)}
\end{gathered}
$$

Thus to establish and maintain a flux density $B_g$ in an air gap of volume $V_g$ a minimum volume of hard iron is required given the rest of the circuit characteristics. Since there is no current present we can neglect the reluctance of the soft iron when there is a magnetized hard iron present.

***

# Energy Conversion #

![Energy Conversion](/static/images/notes/EnergyConversionDiagramStepsActuators.png)

The principle of conservation of energy is widely used when calculating the force or torque developed in an energy conversion device. The electromechanical converter system has an electric system, a mechanical system and a coupling field. 

The electrical energy loss is mainly due to heating in the wires caused by the current, this is known as the $i^2R$ resistance loss of the winding. The magnetic field energy loss is due to the increase in stored field energy in the core's field, this is known as core loss. Mechanical energy loss is due to friction and windage loss of moving components. All losses are converted into heat.

Neglecting the small resistance loss we know that the changes in the electrical energy applied $dW_e$ during a time interval $dt$ will produce a change in the energy supplied to the field (stored and lost) $dW_f$ and a change in the converted mechanical energy $dW_m$ (useful and lost).

$$
dW_e = dW_f + dW_m 
$$

***

## Energy Conversion Process ##

**Stored Field Energy**

![Energy Relay Example](/static/images/notes/FieldEnergyStoredInConversionActuators.png)

For example if we consider a relay where there is a movable part that is kept in static equilibrium by a spring $dW_m=0$ then every change in electrical energy will translate directly into a change in the magnetic field energy $dW_e=dW_f$. From this relation we can calculate the change in electrical energy and the change in magnetic energy in the relay:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Faraday's Law}\\
	e = \frac{N d\Phi}{dt}\\
	\lambda = (N)(\Phi) \implies e = \frac{d\lambda}{dt}\\
	\therefore dW_e = (e)(i)(dt) \land dW_f = (i)(d\lambda)
\end{gathered}
$$

We conclude there is a relation between the flux linkage and the current for an air gap of a particular length (static equilibrium) and therefore the the integral of the current with respect to an interval of flux linkage is the total magnetic field energy stored.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	dW_f = (i)(d\lambda) \implies W_f = \int_{0}^{\lambda} i \, d\lambda\\
	(N)(i) = (H_c)(l_c) + (H_g)(l_g) \land \lambda = (N)(\Phi) = (N)(B)(A)\\
	W_f = \int \left(\frac{(H_c)(l_c) + (H_g)(l_g)}{N}\right) (N)(A) \, dB \\
	W_f = \int \left((H_c)(l_c) + \frac{(B)(l_g)}{\mu_0}\right) (A) \, dB \\
	W_f = \int \left((H_c)(l_c)(A)\,dB + \frac{(B)(l_g)}{\mu_0}(A)\,dB\right) \\
	W_f = \int \left((H_c\,dB)((l_c)(A)) \right) + \frac{B^2}{2\mu_0}((l_g)(A)) \\
	W_f = \left(\int (H_c\,dB_c)\right)(V_c) + \frac{B^2}{2\mu_0}(V_g) \\
	W_f = (w_{fc})(V_c) + (w_{fg})(V_g) = W_{fc} + W_{fg}\\
	w_{fc} = \text{ Energy Density In the Core} \land V_c = \text{ Core's Volume}\\
	W_{fc} = \text{ Energy In the Core}\\
\end{gathered}
$$

Normally $W_{fc}$ can be neglected when compared to $W_{fg}$, also if we consider that the flux linkage and current relation is linear for a particular device then:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	H_c = \frac{B_c}{\mu_c}\\
	\therefore w_{fc} = \int \frac{(B_c)\,dB_c}{\mu_c} (B_c) = \frac{B_c^2}{2\mu_c}
\end{gathered}
$$

***

## Energy and CoEnergy ##

![Mechanical energy curves](/static/images/notes/MechanicalEnergyCurvesActuators.png)

We know that the flux linkage and current relation depends on the air gap length and the magnetization curve of the material. The Co energy is the area under the flux linkage and current relation but integrating the linkage instead of the current $W_f'$, this quantity has no physical meaning but can be used to calculate the final mechanical energy developed by the system.

$$
W_f' = \int_0^{i} \lambda \, di
$$

Again, if we consider that the flux linkage and current relation is linear for a particular device then:

$$
W_f' = W_f = \lambda (i)
$$

When trying to calculate the mechanical energy output we must consider that the system will no longer be in static equilibrium and therefore the length of the air gap will change through time. This change in length will from one point to another will create a change in linkage but not in current as long as the movement is quasistatic. 

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{During motion}\\
	dW_e = \int (e)(i)\,dt = \int_{\lambda 1}^{\lambda 2} (i)\,d\lambda = A_{abcd}\\
	dW_f = A_{0bc} - A_{0ad}\\
	dW_m = dW_e - dW_f\\
	dW_m = A_{abcd} + A_{0bc} - A_{0ad}\\
	dW_m = A_{0ab}\\
\end{gathered}
$$

![Quasistatic And Non Change](/static/images/notes/QuasiAndNonQuasiChangeActuators.png)

The area between the two linkage-current curves $A_{0ab}$ is in fact equal to the change in Co-Energy. From the mechanical energy we can then calculate the mechanical force $f_m$ that generated the change in air gap length (Quasistatic or Energy Method):

$$
\begin{gathered}
	dW_m = A_{0ab} = dW_f'\\
	(f_m)(dx) = dW_m = dW_f'\\
	f_m = \frac{dW_f'(i,x)}{dx}
\end{gathered}
$$

If the movement is not quasistatic and on the contrary it is fast enough then we might consider that the magnetic field linkage remains constant and the mechanical output energy is therefore supplied entirely by the field energy. In other words the mechanical work done can be represented as a simple decrease in the field's energy (Non-Quasistatic or Co-Energy Method):

$$
\begin{gathered}
	dW_m = A_{0ap} = dW_f\\
	(f_m)(dx) = dW_m = -dW_f\\
	f_m = -\frac{dW_f'(\lambda , x)}{dx}
\end{gathered}
$$

***

## Linear Systems ##

If the energy and co-energy force generated is the same we are working with a linear actuator. This will always be true if the magnetic core reluctance is negligible compared to the air gap reluctance, in this cases we can simplify the energy, co-energy and force equations using the coil inductance:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{For linear systems}\\
	\lambda = L(x)(i)\\
	L(x) = \text{ Coil Inductance Function}\\
	W_f = \int (i)\, d\lambda = \int_{0}^{\lambda} \frac{\lambda}{L(x)} \, d\lambda\\
	W_f = \frac{\lambda^2}{(2)(L(x))}\\
	f_m = -\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{\lambda^2}{(2)(L(x))}\right)\\
	f_m = \frac{\lambda^2}{(2)(L^2(x))} \frac{d(L(x))}{dx} = \frac{i^2}{2} \frac{d(L(x))}{dx}\\
	\therefore W_f = W_f' = \frac{i^2(L(x))}{2}
	f_m = \frac{d}{dx}\left( \frac{i^2(L(x))}{2} \right) = \frac{i^2}{2} \frac{d(L(x))}{dx}\\
\end{gathered}
$$

Furthermore if the core reluctance is neglected then:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	(N)(i) = (H_g)(2)(g) = \frac{B_g}{\mu_0}(2)(g)\\
	W_f = \frac{B_g^2}{(2)\mu_0}(2)(g)(A_g)\\
	f_m = \frac{d}{dg}\left( \frac{B_g^2}{(2)\mu_0}(2)(g)(A_g) \right) = \frac{B_g^2}{(2)\mu_0}(2)(A_g)
\end{gathered}
$$

Since the cross sectional area of the gap in this case is $(2)(A_g)$ then the force per unit area of the air gap or *Magnetic Pressure* can be calculated as:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	F_m = \frac{B_g^2}{(2)\mu_0} \, N/m^2
\end{gathered}
$$

## Rotating Machines ##

![Rotator and Stator](/static/images/notes/RotatorStatorComponentsActuators.png)

The moving part in a rotating machine is called *Rotor* and the fixed part *Stator*. The rotor is mounted on a shaft between the ends of the stator. The simplest rotating machine would supply two independent paths, one to the rotor and one to the stator, using two independent coils. The rotor coil are fixed brushes and rotor slip rings. Both currents are taken into account to calculate their corresponding stored field energy:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{ Static Equilibrium}
	dW_f = (e)(i_s) \,dt + (e)(i_r) \,dt\\
	dW_f = (i_s) \,d\lambda_s + (i_r) \,d\lambda_r
\end{gathered}
$$

If we consider that the rotating machine has a linear linkage-current curve then we can also use the coil inductance to represent the rotor and stator field linkage:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\lambda_s = L_{ss}(\theta)(i_s) + L_{sr}(\theta)(i_r)\\
	\lambda_r = L_{rs}(\theta)(i_s) + L_{rr}(\theta)(i_r)\\
	L_{ss} = \text{ Stator Coil Self Inductance}\\
	L_{rr} = \text{ Rotor Coil Self Inductance}\\
	L_{sr} = L_{rs} = \text{ Mutual Inductances}\\
	\text{ Linear System}\\
	L_{sr} = L_{rs}\\
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\lambda_s\\
		\lambda_r
	\end{bmatrix}
	=
	\begin{bmatrix}
		L_{ss} & L_{sr}\\
		L_{rs} & L_{rr}
	\end{bmatrix}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		i_s\\
		i_r
	\end{bmatrix}
	\\
	dW_f = (i_s)d(L_{ss}(i_s)+L_{sr}(i_r)) + (i_r)d(L_{rs}(i_s)+L_{rr}(i_r))\\
	dW_f = L_{ss}(i_s)(di_s) + L_{rr}(i_r)(di_r) + L_{sr}(di_s i_r)\\
	W_f = L_{ss} \int_{0}^{i_s} (i_s)(di_s) + L_{rr} \int_{0}^{i_r} (i_r)(di_r) + L_{sr} \int_{0}^{i_s i_r} (di_s i_r)\\
	W_f = \frac{L_{ss}(i_s^2)}{2} + \frac{L_{rr}(i_r^2)}{2} + L_{sr}(i_s)(i_r)
\end{gathered}
$$

Just like with the magnetic force obtained from the stored field energy (when the current is constant) we can obtain the magnetic torque of the rotating machine:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	T = \frac{dW_f'(i , \theta)}{d\theta}\\
	W_f = W_f' = \text{ Linear System}\\
	T = \frac{(i_s^2)}{2} \frac{dL_{ss}}{d\theta}  + \frac{(i_r^2)}{2} \frac{dL_{rr}}{d\theta} + (i_s)(i_r) \frac{dL_{sr}}{d\theta}
\end{gathered}
$$

Note that the first two terms of the equations are the *Reluctance Torque* produced from the variation of the self inductance as a function of the rotor position while the last term is the *Mutual Inductance Torque* produced from the variation of their mutual inductance as a function of the rotor position. Usually reluctance variation can be achieved simply by the change in air gap length as the rotor rotates.

Just as a motor transforms from electrical into mechanical energy a generator transforms from mechanical energy into electrical energy. In both cases the intermediary or coupling field energy can be described in terms of the charges generated (Lorentz) or in terms of the conductors (Laplace).

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Lorentz's Law} \\
	f = (q)(E + v + B)\\
	\text{Laplace's Law} \\
	\vec{F} = (i)(\vec{l} \times \vec{B})
\end{gathered}
$$

In a generator we can find the induced voltage from the Lenz's Law that states $e = (B)(l)(v)$, where $v$ is the linear velocity of the conductor. From this equation and the Lorentz's Law we can conclude that the force generated by in the conductor is $f = (B)(l)(i)$, also known as Lorentz force. Note that in both cases the three vectors are mutually perpendicular. 

If the rotor or stator are subjected to a time variable magnetic field then the core is usually laminated to decrease energy losses due to parasitic Eddy Currents.

en la maquina dc el de campo nomramente esta en el estator y el de armadura en el rotor.

El voltaje siempre alterna por esta propiedad de los vectores.
Se utiliza n conmutador mecanico y un ensamble de escobillas como rectificador de este voltaje para volverlo unidireccional.

O TAMBIEN SE PUEDE UTILIZAR UN CIRCUITO RECTIFICADOR.


RECTIFICADOR 

LA combinacion de comnutador con escobilla se utiliza como rectificador para hacer que3 el voltaje en las terminales de la armadura sea unidireccional.
Este es mecanico pero tambien puede ser mediante un circuito.

Podemos reemplazar los anillos deslizantes por dos segmentos de conmutacion logrando que el voltaje en las escobillas sea unidireccional.


Una espira o vuelta conforma bobinas al conectarse en serie las cuales forman devanados al conectarse.
Las bobinas del devanado de armadura se pueden conectar mediante tipo lazo o tipo onda.

PARAQ OBTENER EL VOLTAJE INDUCIDO EN LA VUELTA O ESPIRA INDIVIDUAL

$$
\begin{gathered}
	e_t = (2)(B(\theta))(l)(\omega_m)(r)\\
	B(\theta) = \frac{\Phi}{A} = \frac{\Phi(p)}{(2)(\pi)(r)(l)}\\
	e_t = \frac{(\Phi)(p)(\omega_m)}{\pi}
\end{gathered}
$$

VOLTAJE PROIMEDIO EN LAS TERMINALES DEVIDO AL VOLTAJE INDUCIDO POR VUELTA O ESPIRA

$$
\begin{gathered}
	E_a = \frac{(N)(e_t)}{a} = \frac{(N)(p)(\Phi)(\omega_m)}{\pi (a)}\\
	E_a = (K_a)(\Phi)(\omega_m)
\end{gathered}
$$

En donde K es la constante de la maquina o armadura 

EN EL CASO DEL GENERADOR ES EL VOLTAJE INDUCIDO Y EN MOTOR ES LA FUERZA ELECTROMOTRIZ

LA FUERZA O TORQUE GENERADO EN LA ARMADURA SE PUEDE CALCULAR UTILIZANDO LA FUERZA DE Lorentz
