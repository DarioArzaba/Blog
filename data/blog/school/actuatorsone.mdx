# Introduction #

Mechatronic System: Measures signals, processes them and generates an action through actuators. 

1. Structure: Body of the system, how we integrate components.
2. Sensors: Devices that detect physical magnitudes and transforms them to signals.
3. Actuators: Devices that perform actions in response to signals.
4. Controllers: Regulate actuators response time and logic.
5. Interface: Devices that allow two or more systems to interact.

**Mechatronic System Components**

1. Actuators: Solenoid, DC Motor, Stepper Motor, Servomotor, Hydraulic, Pneumatic.
2. Sensors: Interrupter, Potentiometer, Photoelectric, Encoder, Thermocouple, Accelerometer, MEM.
3. Input Signal Conditioning: Discrete Circuits, Amplifiers, Filters, Converters, Transformers.
4. Control Architectures: Logic Circuits, Microcontrollers, PLC, Control Algorithms.
5. Output Signal Conditioning: Amplifiers, Transistors, Op-Amps.
6. Interfaces: LED, Digital Screens, LCD, CRT.

**Control System**

![Control System Example](/static/images/notes/ControlSystemExample.png)

Interconnection of components in a configuration that gives you the desired response or *output signal* with respect to the reference *input signal* we have selected. Control systems allow us to detect a variable and then execute the actions needed to modify its value into the range of values we want. We can find control systems on most systems, for example in animals, machines or businesses. 

**Open Loop Control System**

![Open Loop System](/static/images/notes/OpenLoopControlSystem.png)

Here the output generated depends directly on the input, meaning that we don't compare the controlled output with the reference signal.

![Open Loop System Example](/static/images/notes/OpenLoopControlSystemExample.png)

For example a simple valve. Here the water flow is the input, the valve's position is the element of control, water level in the tank can be the element of correction, filling the tank is the process and maintaining the tank at a certain level is the controlled variable output.

**Closed Loop of Feedback Control System**

![Open Loop System](/static/images/notes/ClosedLoopControlSystem.png)

Here the output generated depends on the input and the corrections performed by the feedback signal, meaning that we compare the controlled output with the reference signal. The difference between the feedback and the input is the error signal used by the controller to drive the actuators needed to change the output closer to the reference. The cycle repeats when the sensor takes additional measurements.

![Open Loop System Example](/static/images/notes/ClosedLoopControlSystemExample.png)

For example, in a heating system the expected temperature is set in a thermostat as a reference or set point, a sensor measures the temperature output and compares it with the reference, their error is then used by the controller to modify the valves of a gas furnace, this generates a feedback signal in the form of new heat that in turn changes output. The cycle repeats as the sensor takes another measurement.

**Actuator**

A device that transforms energy to a desired motion or action, the control system *drives* the actuator by translating the controller's output into a usable signal.

**Actuator Classification**

1. Pneumatic: Transforms the energy of compressed air into to work like linear or circular motion. High power output from low applied force. 
2. Hydraulic: Transforms the energy of incompressible fluids, generally mineral oil, into work. Highest power output from low applied force. 
3. Electric: Transforms electrical energy into mechanical work. Lower overall torque but faster and more precise movements.

**Magnetic Field Concepts**

* Magnetic field $B$: Field that influences moving charges, electric currents and magnetic materials by inducing magnetic forces.
* Magnetic field intensity or strength $H$: Amount of magnetizing force in space. Measured in ampere per meter.
* Magnetic flux density $B$: Amount of magnetic force induced on a body due to a magnetizing force. Measured in tesla.
* Magnetic flux $\Phi$: Surface integral of the flux lines over a surface. Measured in weber.
* Magnetization $M$: Capability of a particular magnetic field strength to increase the magnetic flux density of a material.
* Magnetomotive Force $mmf$: Magnetic force that drives the motion of the magnetic flux through a body.

# Electromagnetic Actuators #


![Linear and Rotational Example](/static/images/notes/LinearandRotationalActuators.png)

Electromagnetic actuators an be classified into *Linear*, for example a solenoid valve, or *Rotational*, for example an electric motor. They are made from magnetic circuits with ferromagnetic or magnetic materials that shape and direct magnetic fields. The magnetic fields are used as a medium (electromagnetic energy) to convert from electrical energy into mechanical energy.

Permanent magnets and a layer of air in rotating machines help maintain the high flux needed to create a large torque. In most electrical machines (except permanent magnet machines) the magnetic flux is produced simply by driving a current through coils wound around a ferromagnetic core.

***

## Electromagnetic Relations ###

**i-H Relation**

![Relationship Magnetic Actuators](/static/images/notes/iHRelationActuators.png)

There is a direct relation between the current in a conductor and the magnetic field strength around it. First the direction of the flux lines can be determined by the *right hand rule*. The relation can be derived from *Ampere's Circuit Law*, stating that the line integral of the magnetic field $B$ around any closed path, when taking incremental steps $dl$, is equal to the total current $i$ linked by the contour times the medium's permeability $\mu_0$.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Ampere's Law}\\
	\oint \vec{B} \, \vec{dl} = (\mu_0)(i)\\\\
	\oint \vec{H} \, \vec{dl} \, \cos(\theta) = \sum i\\\\
	\text{Circle with one current}\\
	\oint H \, dl = i \implies H \oint dl = i\\
	(H)(2 \pi r) = i \implies H = \frac{i}{2 \pi r}
\end{gathered}
$$

By relating the magnetic field strength that surrounds a conductor to its current we can see that:

1. H will be the same at every point along the contour (magnetic field symmetry).
2. H is proportional to the current passing through the conductor.
2. H is inversely proportional to the radius of the contour.

**B-H Relation**

As H increases so does the magnetic flux density $B$. Permeability $\mu$ represents how easily the flux lines can pass through the medium before reaching its saturation point. In ferromagnetic materials such as iron, cobalt and nickel their relative permeability $mu_r$ varies from 100's to 1000's, for electric machines the value typically ranges from 2000 to 6000. We can see that:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	B = (\mu)(H) \, \text{T}\\
	\mu = (\mu_0)(\mu_r) \, \text{H/m}\\
	\mu_0 = 1.256637062 \times 10^{-6}
\end{gathered}
$$


1. A high $H$ will produce a high $B$ through the medium.
2. A high $\mu$ implies that a large $B$ will be obtained from a small current.

**Solenoid Field**

![Solenoid Field](/static/images/notes/SolenoidFieldActuators.png)

When we arrange a conductor into a coil we generate a uniform magnetic field, we call this arrangement a solenoid. As the solenoid increases in length we can see from its electromagnetic symmetry that the flux lines cancel each other out until the only lines remaining are the ones parallel to the solenoid's length. Every single horizontal line inside the solenoid gets amplified by the sum of the individual conductor loops flux lines therefore greatly increasing the overall flux density. 

![Ideal Solenoid Field](/static/images/notes/IdealSolenoidActuators.png)

If we consider an ideal solenoid (infinitely large) then the outside horizontal lines go in opposite directions canceling each other out, furthermore even if the solenoid isn't infinite the density of the outside flux lines is still negligible since their magnetic loop around the solenoid covers a far greater volume. Using an ideal solenoid and applying Ampere's Law to any contour, for example a rectangle where the current passes through gets us the solenoid field equations:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\oint B \, dl = \int_a^b B \, dl + \int_b^c B \, dl + \int_c^d B \, dl + \int_d^a B \, dl\\
	\int_a^b B (0) = 0 \land  \int_c^d B \, (0) = 0\\
	\int_d^a B \, dl = 0 \text{ (ideal solenoid)}\\
	\oint B \, dl = \int_b^c B \, dl\\
	\text{Closed current in the rectangle}\\
	\sum i = i = (i_0)(n)(l)\\
	i_0 = \text{ Applied current}\\
	\text{Ampere's Circuit Law}\\
	\oint \vec{B} \, \vec{dl} = (\mu_0)(i)\\
	(B)(l) = (\mu_0)((i_0)(n))\\
	\therefore B = (\mu_0)(i_0)(n)\\
	n = \text{ Turns per unit of length}
\end{gathered}
$$

This equation states that the flux density inside an ideal solenoid doesn't depend on the radius to the conductor or its overall length just on the current applied and the total number of turns per unit of length. We can see that:

1. To increase the $B$ in a solenoid we can increase the applied current or the number of turns by unit of length.

**Exercise**

A solenoid of length 0.6m has three layers of turns each with 500 turns. Calculate the magnetic field density inside the solenoid if we apply a 2A current.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	B = (\mu_0)(i_0)(n)\\
	B = (1.25663 \times 10^{-6})\frac{(1500)(2)}{0.6} = 0.006283 \, \text{T}
\end{gathered}
$$

## Magnetic Equivalent Circuit ##

![Toroid Only](/static/images/notes/CreatingAToroidActuators.png)

A magnetic circuit can be made by looping a solenoid around a ferromagnetic toroid where most of the flux density will remain inside solenoid's core.  Here the solenoid field equation remains almost the same with the only addition that this time the unit of length instead of being the length of the solenoid will be the circumference of the toroid $l = 2\pi r$.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Solenoid Field}
	\oint \vec{B} \, \vec{dl} = (\mu)(n)(i) \land n = \frac{N}{l}\\
	B = (\mu)(H) \implies \oint \vec{H} \, \vec{dl} = (N)(i)\\
	H (2 \pi r) = (H)(l) = (N)(i) = F\\
	F = \text{ Magnetomotive Force mmf}\\
	\therefore H = \frac{(N)(i)}{l} \, \text{At/m} \land B = (\mu)\frac{(N)(i)}{l} \, \text{T}
\end{gathered}
$$

Since we are using a ferromagnetic core $\mu$ must have a relative value to vacuum. Now that we know the $H$ inside the toroid we can calculate how much flux $\Phi$ there is at any cross sectional area of the core.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\Phi = \int B \, dA = (B)(A) \, \text{Wb}\\
	B = (\mu)\frac{(N)(i)}{l} \, \text{T} \implies \Phi = (\mu)\frac{(N)(i)(A)}{l}\\
	\Phi = \frac{(N)(i)}{\frac{l}{(\mu)(A)}} = \frac{(N)(i)}{\Re} \, \text{Wb}\\
	\Re = \frac{l}{(\mu)(A)} = \frac{1}{P}\\
	\Re = \text{ Magnetic Path Reluctance}\\
	P = \text{ Magnetic Path Permeance}
\end{gathered}
$$

![Equivalent Magnetic Circuit](/static/images/notes/EquivalentMagneticCircuitInActuators.png)

We can use our knowledge of electric circuits with this magnetic circuit by equating the Magnetomotive Force $F$ to the Electromotive Force $E$ , the Flux flow $\Phi = \frac{F}{\Re}$ to the Current $i = \frac{E}{R}$ and the Magnetic Path Reluctance $\Re = \frac{l}{(\mu)(A)}$ to the Resistance $R = \frac{l}{(\sigma)(A)}$. The main difference being that the in a magnetic circuit the power dissipation is not associated with reluctance.

![Magnetization Curve](/static/images/notes/MagnetizationCurvesInActuators.png)

The magnetization curve represents how much $B$ will increase inside the material as we increase $H$, for example by driving a higher current. This relation is linear for low $H$ values but at some point it will reach the material's saturation region. Note that the linear region is characterized by a low reluctance and the saturation region by a high reluctance. We can see that:

1. For different materials you will need a different to achieve the same magnetic flux density.

## Magnetic Circuit with Air Gap ##

![Rotational Machine](/static/images/notes/RotationalMachineWithEquivalentActuators.png)

In rotating machines we leave an air gap between the core (rotor) and the solenoid (stator). This air gap is necessary to maintain a *frictionless* rotation of the motor shaft, in small motors is as small as it can get to reduce electromagnetic energy losses but on larger motors we increase its size to protect the rotor form being pulled into contact with the stator.

A disadvantage of the air gap is that it introduces a higher $F$ requirement to maintain the same flux density in the inside of the solenoid, however it also allows for the core to be completely saturated in a safely manner since the air will remain unsaturated. To account for the air gap we introduce an additional reluctance to the equivalent magnetic circuit .

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\Re_c = \frac{l_c}{(\mu_c)(A_c)}\\
	\Re_g = \frac{l_g}{(\mu_0)(A_g)}\\
	\Phi = \frac{(N)(i)}{\Re} = \frac{(N)(i)}{\Re_c + \Re_g}\\
	(N)(i) = (H_c)(l_c) + (H_g)(l_g)\\ 
	l_c = \text{ Core length} \land l_g = \text{ Air Gap length}\\
	\Phi = (B)(A) \implies B_c = \frac{\Phi_c}{A_c} \land B_g = \frac{\Phi_g}{A_g}
\end{gathered}
$$

Note: Since the air gap isn't contained inside a solenoid, flux lines start to bulge outwards when magnetizing the core, this is known as the fringing effect. To account for it we increase the cross sectional area of the air gap *capturing* the additional flux lines. Most of the time, if the air gap is small, the fringing effect can be neglected and the cross sectional areas remain equal.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{By neglecting the fringing effect}\\
	A_c = A_g = A \land B_c = B_g = \frac{\Phi}{A}
\end{gathered}
$$

**Exercise 1**

![Exercise Air Gap](/static/images/notes/ExerciseofMagnetiEquivalentCircuitAirGapActuators.png)

This is the magnetic circuit of a primitive relay. The coil has 500 turns and the core path length is 360mm. The air gap lengths are 1.5mm each. A flux density of 0.8T is required to actuate the relay. The core is made of cast steel. Calculate the current in the coil, the permeability and relative permeability of the core and the coil current needed to have 0.8T if the air gap was 0.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	F = (N)(i) = (H_c)(l_c) + (H_g)(l_g)(2)\\
	\text{From the graph: } 0.8 \, \text{T} =  510 \, \text{At/m}\\
	F_c = (H_c)(l_c) = (510)(0.36) = 184 \, \text{At}\\
	B = (\mu)(H) \implies H_g = \frac{B_g}{\mu_0}\\
	F_g = (H_g)(l_g)(2) = \frac{(0.8)(0.0015)(2)}{1.25663 \times 10^{-6}}  = 1909.8 \approx 1910 \, \text{At}\\
	(N)(i) = 184 + 1910 \implies i = \frac{2094}{500} = 4.18\,\text{A}\\
	\therefore i = 4.18\,\text{A}\\\\
	B_c = (\mu_c)(H_c) \implies \mu_c = \frac{B_c}{H_c} = \frac{0.8}{510} = 0.00157\\
	\mu = (\mu_0)(\mu_r) \implies \mu_r = \frac{\mu_c}{\mu_0} = \frac{0.00157}{1.25663 \times 10^{-6}} = 1250\\
	\therefore \mu_c = 0.00157 \land \mu_r = 1250\\\\
	(N)(i) = (H_c)(l_c) \implies i = \frac{(H_c)(l_c)}{N} = \frac{(510)(0.36)}{500} = 0.36\,\text{A}\\  
	\therefore i_2 = 0.36\,\text{A}
\end{gathered}
$$

**Exercise 2**

![Exercise Air Gap](/static/images/notes/ExerciseTwoMagnetiEquivalentCircuitAirGapActuators.png)

In this magnetic circuit the relative permeability of the core is 1200. Neglect magnetic leakage and fringing. All length measurements are in centimeters. The material has a square cross sectional area. Calculate the air gap flux, the ait gap flux density and the magnetic field strength inside the air gap.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	N_1 = N_2 = 500 \land i_1 = 10 \land l_g = 0.005\\
	A_c = A_g = 0.0004 \land \mu_r = 1200 \\
	F_1 = F_2 = (N)(i) = (500)(10) = 5000 \, \text{At}\\
	\mu_c = (\mu_r)(\mu_0) = (1200)(1.25663 \times 10^{-6}) = 0.00150796\\
	\Re_{bafe} = \frac{l_{bafe}}{(\mu_c)(A_c)} = \frac{0.52(3)}{(0.00150796)(0.0004)} = 2.58 \times 10^{6} \, \text{At/wb}\\
	\Re_{bafe} = \Re_{bcde} \, \text{By symmetry}\\
	\Re_{be} = \frac{l_{be}}{(\mu_c)(A_c)} = \frac{(0.52)-(0.005)}{(0.00150796)(0.0004)} = 0.82 \times 10^{6} \, \text{At/wb}\\
	\Re_{g} = \frac{l_{g}}{(\mu_0)(A_g)} = \frac{(0.005)}{(1.25663 \times 10^{-6})(0.0004)} = 9.94 \times 10^{6} \, \text{At/wb}\\
	F_1 - (\Re_{bafe})(\Phi_1) - (\Re_{be} + \Re_{g})(\Phi_1 + \Phi_2) = 0\\
	-F_2 + (\Re_{bafe})(\Phi_2) + (\Re_{be} + \Re_{g})(\Phi_1 + \Phi_2) = 0\\
	(\Re_{bafe})(\Phi_2) - (\Re_{bafe})(\Phi_1) = 0 \implies \Phi_2 = \Phi_1\\
	5000 = (2.58 \times 10^{6})(\Phi_1) + (0.82 \times 10^{6} + 9.94 \times 10^{6})(\Phi_1 + \Phi_1) \\
	\Phi_1 = 2.07 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{wb}\\
	\therefore \Phi_g = \Phi_1 + \Phi_2 = (2.07 \times 10^{-4})(2) = 4.14 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{wb}\\
	\therefore B_g = \frac{\Phi_g}{A_g} = \frac{4.14 \times 10^{-4}}{0.0004} = 2.035 \, \text{T}\\
	\therefore H_g = \frac{B_g}{\mu_0} = \frac{2.035}{(1.25663 \times 10^{-6})} = 0.82 \, \text{At/m}
\end{gathered}
$$

## Magnetic Circuit Inductance ##

The coil used in a magnetic circuit may be thought as an inductor, here inductance is defined as the *Magnetic Flux Linkage* $\lambda$ per Ampere of current:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\lambda = (N)(\Phi) \, \text{Wb t}\\
	L = \frac{\lambda}{i} = \frac{(N)(\Phi)}{i} = \frac{(N)(B)(A)}{i} = \frac{(N)(\mu)(H)(A)}{i}\\
	L = \frac{(N)(\mu)(H)(A)}{\frac{H(l)}{N}} = \frac{(\mu)(A)(N)^2}{l} = \frac{N^2}{\Re}
\end{gathered}
$$

***

**Activity 1**

Using the following data calculate the magnetic flux, magnetic flux density and inductance of a simple air gap magnetic circuit.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	N = 400 \land i = 1 \land l_c = 0.5 \land l_g = 0.001\\
	A_c = A_g = 0.0015 \land \mu_r = 3000\\\\
	\mu_c = (\mu_r)(\mu_0) = (3000)(1.256 \times 10^{-6}) = 0.003769\\
	\Re_c = \frac{l_c}{(\mu_c)(A_c)} = \frac{0.5}{(0.003769)(0.0015)} = 88419 \, \text{At}{wb}\\
	\Re_g = \frac{l_g}{(\mu_0)(A_g)} = \frac{0.001}{(1.256 \times 10^{-6})(0.0015)} = 530516 \, \text{At}{wb}\\
	\therefore \Phi = \frac{(N)(i)}{\Re_c + \Re_g} = \frac{(400)(1)}{88419+530516} = 0.00064627 \, \text{Wb}\\
	\therefore B_g = \frac{\Phi}{A} = \frac{0.00064627}{0.0015} = 0.43085 \, \text{T}\\
	\therefore L = \frac{(N)^2}{\Re} = \frac{(400)^2}{88419+530516} = 0.25852 \, \text{H}
\end{gathered}
$$

**Activity 2**

We apply 2.5A to a coil around a toroid with no air gap and 250 turns. The toroid is made of silicon sheet steel. For the toroid with respect to its center its inner radii is of 20cm and its outer radii is of 25cm. Calculate the magnetic flux density at the mean radius of the toroid and the coil inductance. 

$$
\begin{gathered}
	r_m = \frac{25+20}{2} = 22.5 \, \text{cm} = 0.225 \, \text{m}\\
	H_c = \frac{(N)(i)}{l} = \frac{(250)(2.5)}{2 \pi 0.225} = 442.3 \, \text{At/m}\\
	\therefore B_c = 1.225 \, \text{T}\\\\
	A = \pi(r_A)^2 = \pi(\frac{25-20}{2})^2 = 1.9635 \times 10^{-3}\\
	\Phi = (B)(A) = (1.225)(1.9635 \times 10^{-3}) = 0.002405 \, \text{wb}\\
	\lambda = (N)(\Phi) =  (250)(0.002405) = 0.60132 \, \text{Wb t}\\
	\therefore L = \frac{0.60132}{2.5} = 240.4 \, \text{mH}
\end{gathered}
$$

## Hysteresis ##

![Hysteresis Curves](/static/images/notes/HysteresisCurvesMagnetActuators.png)

Magnetic hysteresis, from the Greek word of *being late*, means that the magnetic material will retain the magnetic flux (residual) acquired through the increase of the magnetic field strength. Once magnetized the opposing magnetic field strength needed to demagnetize the material is called the coercivity or coercive force. 

Depending on the material, the current and the current magnetic saturation you can form hysteresis of different shapes and sizes, in practice the bigger the hysteresis the lower the current you need to keep the core magnetized, however it will also lower the overall response time of the actuator.

**Sinusoidal Excitation**

![Sinusoidal Excitation](/static/images/notes/SinusoidalExitationActuators.png)

When you apply an AC voltage source to a magnetic circuit it will produce a sinusoidal excitation, being an inductor we will see a phase angle between the induced voltage and the magnetic flux of the circuit. The relation between the induced voltage and the magnetic flux is determined by Faraday's Law.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\Phi(t) = \Phi_{max}(\sin(\omega (t)))\\
	\Phi_{max}  = \text{ Core flux amplitude}\\
	\omega  = \text{ Angular frequency} = 2\pi f\\
	\text{Applying Faraday's Law}\\
	e(t) = N\frac{d\Phi}{dt}\\
	e(t) = N(\Phi)(\omega)(\cos(\omega (t)))\\
	e(t) = E_{max}(\cos(\omega (t)))\\
	E_{rms} = \frac{E_max}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{N\Phi_{max} \omega}{\sqrt{2}} = 4.44Nf\phi_{max}
\end{gathered}
$$

**Exercise 1**

Given a sinusoidal excitation obtain an expression for the flux density in the core and for the current in the coil (no air gap).

$$
\begin{gathered}
	e(t) = 1\Phi\,120\text{Vrms}\,60\text{Hz} \land N = 200\\
	l_c = 100\,\text{cm} \land A_c = 20\,\text{cm}^2 \land \mu_r = 2500\\\\
	\Phi_{max} = \frac{120}{(4.44)(200)(60)} = 0.00225 \, \text{wb}\\
	\Phi = (B)(A) \implies B_{max} = \frac{\Phi_{max}}{A}\\
	B_{max} = \frac{0.00225 \, \text{wb}}{20\times 10^{-4}\, \text{m}} = 1.126 \, \text{T}\\
	\therefore B = B_{max}(\sin(\omega (t))) = 1.126(\sin(120\pi (t)))\\\\
	(N)(i) = (A)(l) \implies i_{max} = \frac{(H_{max})(l)}{N}\\
	H_{max} = \frac{B_{max}}{\mu_r(\mu_0)} = \frac{1.126}{(2500)(1.256 \times 10^{-6})} = 358.5 \, \text{At/m}\\
	i_{max} = \frac{(358.5)(1)}{200} = 1.79 \, \text{A}\\
	\therefore i = 1.79(\sin(120 \pi (t)))
\end{gathered}
$$

**Permanent Magnet**

![Permanent Magnet](/static/images/notes/PermanentMagnetHysteresisCurveActuators.png)

By introducing a material with a high hysteresis into the magnetic circuit we can create a permanent magnet. The permanent magnet will maintain the magnetic flux required for the application with little to none additional current, they are made from iron, nickel and cobalt and usually called *hard iron* while the rest of the unmagnetized core is called *soft iron*. 

We start by magnetizing the hard iron with a positive magnetic field strength, after we remove the current the permanent magnet will retain its maximum magnetic flux, we call this the operating point of the permanent magnet. 

**Magnetization**

By applying a reversed magnetic field strength we can adjust the operating point of the magnet. From the operating point in the hysteresis loop and the presence or absence of the keeper the magnetic flux will be confined to the recoil line between the operating point and the vertical axis. Note that removing the keeper makes the air gap the active magnetic field region of the circuit. Assuming no leakage, no fringing and no soft iron reluctance:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	(H_m)(l_m) = (H_g)(l_g) = 0\\
	H_g = (H_m)\frac{-l_m}{l_g}\\
	\Phi = (B_m)(A_m) = (B_g)(A_g)\\
	B_m = \frac{(A_g)(B_g)}{(A_m)}\\
	B_g = (\mu_0)(H_g)\\
	\therefore B_m = -\frac{(\mu_0)(A_g)(l_m)(H_m)}{(A_m)(l_g)}
\end{gathered}
$$

![Shear Line](/static/images/notes/ShearLineImageDemagnetizeActuators.png)

This equation represents a straight line through the origin called the *shear line*. The intersection of the shear line with the demagnetization curve determines the new operating values $B$ and $H$ of the hard iron (with no keeper in the air gap). If the keeper is reinserted the operating point moves up the recoil line $bc$. This indicates that the operating point of a permanent magnet can be adjusted by adjusting the shear line.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	V_m = (A_m)(l_m)\\
	V_m = \frac{(B_g)(A_g)(H_g)(l_g)}{(B_m)(H_m)}\\
	V_m = \frac{(B_g)^2(V_g)}{(\mu_0)(B_m)(H_m)}
\end{gathered}
$$

Thus to establish and maintain a flux density $B_g$ in an air gap of volume $V_g$ a minimum volume of hard iron is required given the rest of the circuit characteristics. Since there is no current present we can neglect the reluctance of the soft iron when there is a magnetized hard iron present.

**Exercise 2**

![Example of Hard Iron](/static/images/notes/ExampleofHardIronActuators.png)

The permanent magnet is made of alnico 5, its magnetization curve is shown in the figure. A flux density of $0.8T$ needs to be established in the air gap when the keeper is removed. The operating point on the curve corresponds to the point at which the product of the field strength and the flux density are at their maximum: $B_m = 0.95\,\text{T}$ and $H_m = -42\,\text{kA/m}$.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	A_g = 2.5\,\text{cm}^2 \land I_g = 0.4\,\text{cm}\\
\end{gathered}
$$
