# Introduction #

Mechatronic System: Measures signals, processes them and generates an action through actuators. 

1. Structure: Body of the system, how we integrate components.
2. Sensors: Devices that detect physical magnitudes and transforms them to signals.
3. Actuators: Devices that perform actions in response to signals.
4. Controllers: Regulate actuators response time and logic.
5. Interface: Devices that allow two or more systems to interact.

**Mechatronic System Components**

1. Actuators: Solenoid, DC Motor, Stepper Motor, Servomotor, Hydraulic, Pneumatic.
2. Sensors: Interrupter, Potentiometer, Photoelectric, Encoder, Thermocouple, Accelerometer, MEM.
3. Input Signal Conditioning: Discrete Circuits, Amplifiers, Filters, Converters, Transformers.
4. Control Architectures: Logic Circuits, Microcontrollers, PLC, Control Algorithms.
5. Output Signal Conditioning: Amplifiers, Transistors, Op-Amps.
6. Interfaces: LED, Digital Screens, LCD, CRT.

**Control System**

![Control System Example](/static/images/notes/ControlSystemExample.png)

Interconnection of components in a configuration that gives you the desired response or *output signal* with respect to the reference *input signal* we have selected. Control systems allow us to detect a variable and then execute the actions needed to modify its value into the range of values we want. We can find control systems on most systems, for example in animals, machines or businesses. 

**Open Loop Control System**

![Open Loop System](/static/images/notes/OpenLoopControlSystem.png)

Here the output generated depends directly on the input, meaning that we don't compare the controlled output with the reference signal.

![Open Loop System Example](/static/images/notes/OpenLoopControlSystemExample.png)

For example a simple valve. Here the water flow is the input, the valve's position is the element of control, water level in the tank can be the element of correction, filling the tank is the process and maintaining the tank at a certain level is the controlled variable output.

**Closed Loop of Feedback Control System**

![Open Loop System](/static/images/notes/ClosedLoopControlSystem.png)

Here the output generated depends on the input and the corrections performed by the feedback signal, meaning that we compare the controlled output with the reference signal. The difference between the feedback and the input is the error signal used by the controller to drive the actuators needed to change the output closer to the reference. The cycle repeats when the sensor takes additional measurements.

![Open Loop System Example](/static/images/notes/ClosedLoopControlSystemExample.png)

For example, in a heating system the expected temperature is set in a thermostat as a reference or set point, a sensor measures the temperature output and compares it with the reference, their error is then used by the controller to modify the valves of a gas furnace, this generates a feedback signal in the form of new heat that in turn changes output. The cycle repeats as the sensor takes another measurement.

**Actuator**

A device that transforms energy to a desired motion or action, the control system *drives* the actuator by translating the controller's output into a usable signal.

**Actuator Classification**

1. Pneumatic: Transforms the energy of compressed air into to work like linear or circular motion. High power output from low applied force. 
2. Hydraulic: Transforms the energy of incompressible fluids, generally mineral oil, into work. Highest power output from low applied force. 
3. Electric: Transforms electrical energy into mechanical work. Lower overall torque but faster and more precise movements.

**Magnetic Field Concepts**

* Magnetic field $B$: Field that influences moving charges, electric currents and magnetic materials by inducing magnetic forces.
* Magnetic field intensity or strength $H$: Amount of magnetizing force in space. Measured in ampere per meter equal to an ampere-turn per meter $At/m$.
* Magnetic flux density $B$: Amount of magnetic force induced on a body due to a magnetizing force. Measured in tesla $T$.
* Magnetic flux $\Phi$: Surface integral of the flux lines over a surface. Measured in weber $Wb$.
* Magnetization $M$: Capability of a particular magnetic field strength to increase the magnetic flux density of a material.
* Magnetomotive Force $mmf$: Magnetic force that drives the motion of the magnetic flux through a body.

# Electromagnetic Actuators #

![Linear and Rotational Example](/static/images/notes/LinearandRotationalActuators.png)

Electromagnetic actuators an be classified into *Linear*, for example a solenoid valve, or *Rotational*, for example an electric motor. They are made from magnetic circuits with ferromagnetic or magnetic materials that shape and direct magnetic fields. The magnetic fields are used as a medium (electromagnetic energy) to convert from electrical energy into mechanical energy.

Permanent magnets and a layer of air in rotating machines help maintain the high flux needed to create a large torque. In most electrical machines (except permanent magnet machines) the magnetic flux is produced simply by driving a current through coils wound around a ferromagnetic core.

***

## Electromagnetic Relations ###

**i-H Relation**

![Relationship Magnetic Actuators](/static/images/notes/iHRelationActuators.png)

There is a direct relation between the current in a conductor and the magnetic field strength around it. First the direction of the flux lines can be determined by the *right hand rule*. The relation can be derived from *Ampere's Circuit Law*, stating that the line integral of the magnetic field $B$ around any closed path, when taking incremental steps $dl$, is equal to the total current $i$ linked by the contour times the medium's permeability $\mu_0$.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Ampere's Law}\\
	\oint \vec{B} \, \vec{dl} = (\mu_0)(i)\\
	\oint \vec{H} \, \vec{dl} \, \cos(\theta) = \sum i\\
	\text{Circle with one current}\\
	\oint H \, dl = i \implies H \oint dl = i\\
	(H)(2 \pi r) = i \implies H = \frac{i}{2 \pi r}\\\\
	\text{i H Relation}\\
	\boxed{H = \frac{i}{2 \pi r}}
\end{gathered}
$$

By relating the magnetic field strength that surrounds a conductor to its current we can see that:

1. H will be the same at every point along the contour (magnetic field symmetry).
2. H is proportional to the current passing through the conductor.
2. H is inversely proportional to the radius of the contour.

**B-H Relation**

As H increases so does the magnetic flux density $B$. Permeability $\mu$ represents how easily the flux lines can pass through the medium before reaching its saturation point. In ferromagnetic materials such as iron, cobalt and nickel their relative permeability $mu_r$ varies from 100's to 1000's, for electric machines the value typically ranges from 2000 to 6000. We can see that:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{B H Relation}\\
	B = (\mu)(H) \, \text{T}\\
	\mu = (\mu_0)(\mu_r) \, \text{H/m}\\
	\mu_0 = 1.256637062 \times 10^{-6}
\end{gathered}
$$


1. A high $H$ will produce a high $B$ through the medium.
2. A high $\mu$ implies that a large $B$ will be obtained from a small current.

**Solenoid Field**

![Solenoid Field](/static/images/notes/SolenoidFieldActuators.png)

When we arrange a conductor into a coil we generate a uniform magnetic field, we call this arrangement a solenoid. As the solenoid increases in length we can see from its electromagnetic symmetry that the flux lines cancel each other out until the only lines remaining are the ones parallel to the solenoid's length. Every single horizontal line inside the solenoid gets amplified by the sum of the individual conductor loops flux lines therefore greatly increasing the overall flux density. 

![Ideal Solenoid Field](/static/images/notes/IdealSolenoidActuators.png)

If we consider an ideal solenoid (infinitely large) then the outside horizontal lines go in opposite directions canceling each other out, furthermore even if the solenoid isn't infinite the density of the outside flux lines is still negligible since their magnetic loop around the solenoid covers a far greater volume. Using an ideal solenoid and applying Ampere's Law to any contour, for example a rectangle where the current passes through, gets us the solenoid field equations:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\oint B \, dl = \int_a^b B \, dl + \int_b^c B \, dl + \int_c^d B \, dl + \int_d^a B \, dl\\
	\int_a^b B (0) = 0 \land  \int_c^d B \, (0) = 0\\
	\int_d^a B \, dl = 0 \text{ (ideal solenoid)}\\
	\oint B \, dl = \int_b^c B \, dl\\
	\text{Closed i in Rectangle}\\
	\sum i = i = (i_0)(n)(l)\\
	i_0 = \text{ Applied Current}\\
	\text{Ampere's Circuit Law}\\
	\oint \vec{B} \, \vec{dl} = (\mu_0)(i)\\
	(B)(l) = (\mu_0)((i_0)(n))\\
	n = \text{ Turns per unit of length}\\\\
	\text{Solenoid Field Equation}\\
	B = (\mu_0)(i_0)(n)
\end{gathered}
$$

This equation states that the flux density inside an ideal solenoid doesn't depend on the radius to the conductor or its overall length just on the current applied and the total number of turns per unit of length. We can see that:

1. To increase the $B$ in a solenoid we can increase the applied current or the number of turns by unit of length.

***

## Magnetic Equivalent Circuit ##

![Toroid Only](/static/images/notes/CreatingAToroidActuators.png)

A magnetic circuit can be made by looping a solenoid around a ferromagnetic toroid core so that most of the flux density will remain inside.  Here the solenoid field equation remains almost the same only that this time the unit of length instead of being the length of the solenoid will be the circumference of the toroid: $l = 2\pi r$.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Solenoid Field Equation}\\
	\oint \vec{B} \, \vec{dl} = (\mu)(n)(i) \land n = \frac{N}{l}\\
	B = (\mu)(H) \implies \oint \vec{H} \, \vec{dl} = (N)(i)\\\\
	\text{Magnetomotive Force}\\
	F = (H)(l) = (H)(2 \pi r) = (N)(i)\\
	\text{Toroid Magnetic Circuit}\\
	H = \frac{(N)(i)}{l}\\
	B = (\mu)\frac{(N)(i)}{l}\\
\end{gathered}
$$

Since we are using a ferromagnetic core then $\mu$ must be considered relative to vacuum. From the equation of $H$ inside the toroid we can now calculate the flux $\Phi$ at any cross sectional area of the core.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\Phi = \int B \, dA \implies \Phi = (B)(A)\\
	B = (\mu)\frac{(N)(i)}{l} \implies \Phi = (\mu)\frac{(N)(i)(A)}{l}\\
	\Phi = \frac{(N)(i)}{\frac{l}{(\mu)(A)}} \implies \Phi = \frac{(N)(i)}{\Re}\\
	\Re = \frac{l}{(\mu)(A)} = \frac{1}{P}\\
	\Re = \text{ Magnetic Path Reluctance}\\
	P = \text{ Magnetic Path Permeance}\\\\
	\text{Magnetic Flux Inside the Core}\\
	\Phi = (\mu)\frac{(N)(i)(A)}{l} = \frac{(N)(i)}{\Re}
\end{gathered}
$$

![Equivalent Magnetic Circuit](/static/images/notes/EquivalentMagneticCircuitInActuators.png)

We can use our knowledge of electric circuits with this magnetic circuit by equating the Magnetomotive Force $F$ to the Electromotive Force $E$ , the Flux flow $\Phi = \frac{F}{\Re}$ to the Current $i = \frac{E}{R}$ and the Magnetic Path Reluctance $\Re = \frac{l}{(\mu)(A)}$ to the Resistance $R = \frac{l}{(\sigma)(A)}$. The main difference being that in this case power dissipation is not associated with reluctance.

**Magnetization Curve**

![Magnetization Curve](/static/images/notes/MagnetizationCurvesInActuators.png)

The magnetization curve represents how much $B$ will increase inside the material as we increase $H$, by driving a higher current for example. This relation is linear at low $H$ values but at some point the material will reach its saturation region. Note that the linear region is characterized by a low reluctance and the saturation region by a high reluctance. We can see that:

1. For different materials a different field strength is needed to achieve the same magnetic flux density.

***

## Magnetic Circuit with Air Gap ##

![Rotational Machine](/static/images/notes/RotationalMachineWithEquivalentActuators.png)

In rotating machines we leave an air gap between the core (rotor) and the solenoid (stator). This air gap is necessary to maintain the *frictionless* rotation of the motor shaft, in small motors its length is reduced to balanced the electromagnetic energy losses it produces but on bigger motors its length may be increased to protect the rotor from being pulled into contact with the stator. 

Air gaps introduce higher $F$ requirements to maintain the same flux density $\Phi$ inside the core however they allow the rest of the core to reach its saturation point safely. In the equivalent magnetic circuit model we account for air gaps as an additional reluctances $\Re_g$.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\Re_c = \frac{l_c}{(\mu_c)(A_c)} \land \Re_g = \frac{l_g}{(\mu_0)(A_g)}\\
	\Phi = \frac{(N)(i)}{\Re} = \frac{(N)(i)}{\Re_c + \Re_g}\\
	F = (N)(i) = (H)(l) \implies (H)(l) = (H_c)(l_c) + (H_g)(l_g)\\
	\Phi = (B)(A) \implies B_c = \frac{\Phi_c}{A_c} \land B_g = \frac{\Phi_g}{A_g}
\end{gathered}
$$

**Fringing Effect**

Since the air gap isn't contained inside a solenoid, flux lines will start to bulge outwards when magnetizing the core, this is known as the fringing effect. To account for then we normally increase the cross sectional area of the air gap therefore *capturing* the additional flux lines. Most of the time, if the air gap is relatively small, the fringing effect can be neglected.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Neglecting Fringing Effect}\\
	A_c = A_g = A\\
	B_c = B_g = B = \frac{\Phi}{A}\\\\
	\text{Magnetic Circuit Air Gap}\\
	F = (N)(i) = (H_c)(l_c) + (H_g)(l_g)\\
	B = \frac{\Phi}{A}
\end{gathered}
$$

***

## Magnetic Circuit Inductance ##

The coil used in the magnetic circuit as the flux source can be thought of as an inductor where the inductance of the coil is defined as the Magnetic Flux Linkage $\lambda$ per Ampere of current:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\lambda = (N)(\Phi)\\
	L = \frac{\lambda}{i} = \frac{(N)(\Phi)}{i} = \frac{(N)(B)(A)}{i} = \frac{(N)(\mu)(H)(A)}{i}\\
	L = \frac{(N)(\mu)(H)(A)}{\frac{H(l)}{N}} = \frac{(\mu)(A)(N)^2}{l} = \frac{N^2}{\Re}\\\\
	\text{Flux Linkage and Inductance}\\
	\lambda = (N)(\Phi)\\
	L = \frac{N^2}{\Re}
\end{gathered}
$$

***

## Hysteresis ##

![Hysteresis Curves](/static/images/notes/HysteresisCurvesMagnetActuators.png)

Magnetic hysteresis, from the Greek word of *being late*, means that the magnetic material will retain some residual magnetic flux acquired through the increase of the magnetic field strength. Once the material is magnetized an opposite magnetic field strength is needed to demagnetize the material, this is called the coercivity or coercive force.

Depending on the material, the current applied and the magnetic saturation you can form hysteresis curves of different shapes and sizes, in practice the bigger the hysteresis curve the lower the current needed to keep the core magnetized, the tradeoff is that this will also lower the overall response time of the actuator.

**Sinusoidal Excitation**

![Sinusoidal Excitation](/static/images/notes/SinusoidalExitationActuators.png)

When you apply an AC voltage source (with its corresponding current) to a magnetic circuit this will produce a sinusoidal excitation, since the coil acts as an inductor we will see a phase angle between the induced voltage and the magnetic flux. The relation between the induced voltage and the magnetic flux is determined by Faraday's Law.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\Phi(t) = \Phi_{max}(\sin(\omega (t)))\\
	\Phi_{max}  = \text{ Flux Amplitude}\\
	\omega  = 2\pi f = \text{ Angular Frequency}\\
	\text{Faraday's Law}\\
	e(t) = N\frac{d\Phi}{dt}\\
	e(t) = (N)(\Phi_{max})(\omega)(\cos(\omega (t)))\\
	e(t) = E_{max}(\cos(\omega (t)))\\
	E_{rms} = \frac{E_{max}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{(N)(\Phi_{max})(\omega)}{\sqrt{2}}\\\\
	\text{Voltage Flux Relation}\\
	E_{rms} = (4.44)(N)(f)(\Phi_{max})
\end{gathered}
$$

**Permanent Magnet**

![Permanent Magnet](/static/images/notes/PermanentMagnetHysteresisCurveActuators.png)

By introducing a material with high hysteresis into the magnetic circuit path we are creating a permanent magnet. This permanent magnet will help maintain the magnetic flux we obtain with little to none additional current, generally the high hysteresis component or hard iron is made from iron, nickel or cobalt while the rest of the unmagnetized core is called the soft iron. 

Ideally after magnetizing the hard iron with a positive magnetic field and removing the applied current the permanent magnet will retain its maximum magnetic flux (point a), this is called its operating point. With a negative magnetic field ($-H_1$) we can adjust the operating point of the permanent magnet (to point b). 

From the hysteresis loop and the presence or absence of the keeper, the magnetic flux will be confined to the recoil line (line b to c) between the operating point (b) and the vertical axis (a). Note that removing the keeper makes the air gap the active magnetic field region of the circuit, meaning that the electromotive force of the air gap $F_g$ will equal the electromotive force of the permanent magnet $F_m$. Therefore, assuming no leakage, no fringing and no soft iron reluctance:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	F_g = F_m \implies (H_m)(l_m) + (H_g)(l_g) = 0\\
	H_g = (H_m)\left(\frac{-l_m}{l_g}\right)\\
	\Phi = (B_m)(A_m) = (B_g)(A_g)\\
	B_m = \frac{(A_g)(B_g)}{(A_m)}\\
	B_g = (\mu_0)(H_g)\\\\
	\text{Permanent Magnet with Air Gap}\\
	(H_m)(l_m) + (H_g)(l_g) = 0
	\text{Shear Line Equation}\\
	B_m = -\frac{(\mu_0)(A_g)(l_m)(H_m)}{(A_m)(l_g)}
\end{gathered}
$$

![Shear Line](/static/images/notes/ShearLineImageDemagnetizeActuators.png)

The shear line equation represents the straight line that passes through the origin and the operating point of the permanent magnet, the intersection between the shear line and the demagnetization curve determines the new operating values (B and H) of the permanent magnet (hard iron). Note that if we reinsert the keeper then the operating point will move up the recoil line. 

$$
\begin{gathered}
	V_m = (A_m)(l_m)\\
	V_m = \frac{(B_g)(A_g)(H_g)(l_g)}{(B_m)(H_m)}\\
	V_m = \frac{(B_g)^2(V_g)}{(\mu_0)(B_m)(H_m)}
\end{gathered}
$$

The shear line equation can be used to relate volume of the hard iron needed to maintain a particular magnetic flux density inside the air gap. Note that since the hard iron removes the need of an applied current we can usually neglect the reluctance of the soft iron in the equivalent magnetic circuit.

# Energy Conversion #

![Energy Conversion](/static/images/notes/EnergyConversionDiagramStepsActuators.png)

The principle of conservation of energy is widely used when calculating the force or torque developed in an energy conversion machine. The electromechanical converter system has an electrical system, a mechanical system and a coupling field between them. 

* The electrical energy loss is mainly due to heating in the wires, this is known as the $i^2R$ resistance loss of the winding. 
* The magnetic field energy loss is due to the increase in the stored field energy of the core's field, also known as core loss. 
* Mechanical energy loss is due to friction and windage losses of moving components. All losses are converted into heat.

Neglecting the small resistance loss we know that the changes in the electrical energy applied $dW_e$ during a time interval $dt$ will produce a change in the energy supplied to the field (stored and lost) $dW_f$ and in the final mechanical energy $dW_m$ (useful and lost).

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Conservation of Energy}\\
	dW_e = dW_f + dW_m 
\end{gathered}
$$

***

## Energy Conversion Process ##

**Stored Field Energy**

![Energy Relay Example](/static/images/notes/FieldEnergyStoredInConversionActuators.png)

For example if we consider a relay where there is a movable part that is kept in static equilibrium by a spring $dW_m=0$ then every change in electrical energy will translate directly into a change in the magnetic field energy $dW_e=dW_f$. From this conditions we can calculate the change in electrical energy and the change in magnetic energy in the relay:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Faraday's Law}\\
	e(t) = \frac{N d\Phi}{dt}\\
	\lambda = (N)(\Phi) \implies e(t) = \frac{d\lambda}{dt}\\\\
	\text{Electrical and Field Energy Change}\\
	dW_e = (e)(i)(dt) \land dW_f = (i)(d\lambda)
\end{gathered}
$$

Note that the electrical and field energy change equations represent a machine with a fixed air gap length (no mechanical energy changes). By integrating the equations we can calculate the stored magnetic field energy $W_f$ or the induced electrical energy $W_e$ of the machine.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	dW_f = (i)(d\lambda) \implies W_f = \int_{0}^{\lambda} i \, d\lambda\\
	(N)(i) = (H_c)(l_c) + (H_g)(l_g)\\
	\lambda = (N)(\Phi) = (N)(B)(A)\\
	W_f = \int \left(\frac{(H_c)(l_c) + (H_g)(l_g)}{N}\right) (N)(A) \, dB \\
	W_f = \int \left((H_c)(l_c) + \frac{(B)(l_g)}{\mu_0}\right) (A) \, dB \\
	W_f = \int \left((H_c)(l_c)(A)\,dB + \frac{(B)(l_g)}{\mu_0}(A)\,dB\right) \\
	W_f = \frac{B^2}{2\mu_0}((l_g)(A)) + \int \left((H_c\,dB)((l_c)(A)) \right)\\
	W_f = \frac{B^2}{2\mu_0}(V_g) + \left(\int (H_c\,dB_c)\right)(V_c)\\
	W_f = (w_{fc})(V_c) + (w_{fg})(V_g) = W_{fc} + W_{fg}\\
	w_{fc} = \text{ Energy Density In the Core}\\
	V_c = \text{ Core's Volume}\\
	W_{fc} = \text{ Energy In the Core}\\\\
	\text{Field Energy Stored}\\
	W_f = (w_{fc})(V_c) + (w_{fg})(V_g)
\end{gathered}
$$

Normally $W_{fc}$ can be neglected when compared to $W_{fg}$. If the flux linkage and current relation happens to be linear for a particular device then:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	H_c = \frac{B_c}{\mu_c}\\
	w_{fc} = \int \frac{(B_c)\,dB_c}{\mu_c} (B_c) = \frac{B_c^2}{2\mu_c}\\\\
	\text{Field Energy Density Approximation}\\
	w_{fc} = \frac{B_c^2}{2\mu_c}
\end{gathered}
$$

***

## Energy and CoEnergy ##

![Mechanical energy curves](/static/images/notes/MechanicalEnergyCurvesActuators.png)

We know that the linkage - current (magnetic to electric) relation is dependent on the air gap length and the particular magnetization curve of the material. We call co-energy to the area under the linkage - current curve, in other words to the integral of the linkage with respect to the current $W_f'$ instead of the integral of the current with respect to the linkage $W_f$.

The co-energy has no physical meaning but is useful when trying to determine the mechanical energy that the machine has developed:

$$
W_f' = \int_0^{i} \lambda \, di
$$

Again, if the flux linkage and current relation happens to be linear for a particular device then:

$$
W_f' = W_f = \lambda (i)
$$

![Quasistatic And Non Change](/static/images/notes/QuasiAndNonQuasiChangeActuators.png)

When calculating the mechanical energy output we must consider that the system can't be in static equilibrium, this means the length of the air gap will change through time. This change in air gap length will correspond to an additional change in linkage (with respect to time) however we can neglect the additional change in current (with respect to time) as long as the movement is quasistatic.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{During motion}\\
	dW_e = \int (e)(i)\,dt = \int_{\lambda 1}^{\lambda 2} (i)\,d\lambda = A_{abcd}\\
	dW_f = A_{0bc} - A_{0ad}\\
	dW_m = dW_e - dW_f\\
	dW_m = A_{abcd} + A_{0bc} - A_{0ad}\\\\
	\text{Mechanical Energy Output}\\
	dW_m = A_{0ab}
\end{gathered}
$$

Here is where the concept of co-energy is useful since the area between the two linkage - current curves is in fact equal to the change in co-energy. Once we have calculated the mechanical energy output we can then obtain the mechanical force $f_m$ that caused the corresponding change in air gap length (Quasistatic or Energy Method).

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Quasistatic Movement Force}\\
	dW_m = A_{0ab} = dW_f'\\
	(f_m)(dx) = dW_m = dW_f'\\
	f_m = \frac{dW_f'(i,x)}{dx}
\end{gathered}
$$

If on the contrary the movement is non-quasistatic from a quick change in air gap length then we might consider that the linkage remains constant therefore the mechanical energy output will come entirely from the the field energy stored, meaning that the mechanical work done can be represented as a simple decrease in the field's energy (Non-Quasistatic or CoEnergy Method).

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{NonQuasistatic Movement Force}\\
	dW_m = A_{0ap} = dW_f\\
	(f_m)(dx) = dW_m = -dW_f\\
	f_m = -\frac{dW_f(\lambda , x)}{dx}
\end{gathered}
$$

***

## Linear Systems ##

![Exercise of a Linear System](/static/images/notes/LinearSystemsFieldExerciseActuators.png)

If the mechanical force calculated from the energy and the co-energy is the same then the linkage - current relation is perfectly linear and the machine must be a linear actuator. When working with linear systems, as long as the core reluctance is negligible compared to its air gap reluctance then we can simplify the mechanical force equations by using the coil inductance equation:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\lambda = L(x)(i) \land W_f' = W_f\\ 
	W_f = \int (i)\, d\lambda = \int_{0}^{\lambda} \frac{\lambda}{L(x)} \, d\lambda\\
	W_f = \frac{\lambda^2}{(2)(L(x))}\\
	\text{Energy Method}\\
	f_m = -\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{\lambda^2}{(2)(L(x))}\right)\\
	f_m = \frac{\lambda^2}{(2)(L^2(x))} \frac{d(L(x))}{dx} = \frac{i^2}{2} \frac{d(L(x))}{dx}\\
	f_m = \frac{dW_f(i,x)}{dx}\\
	W_f = \frac{i^2(L(x))}{2}\\
	\text{CoEnergy Method}\\
	f_m = \frac{d}{dx}\left( \frac{i^2(L(x))}{2} \right) = \frac{i^2}{2} \frac{d(L(x))}{dx}\\\\
	\text{Linear Mechanical Force}\\
	f_m = \frac{i^2}{2} \frac{d(L(x))}{dx}
\end{gathered}
$$

Furthermore if the core reluctance is neglected then:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	(N)(i) = (H_g)(2)(g) = \frac{B_g}{\mu_0}(2)(g)\\
	W_f = \frac{B_g^2}{(2)\mu_0}(2)(g)(A_g)\\
	f_m = \frac{d}{dg}\left( \frac{B_g^2}{(2)\mu_0}(2)(g)(A_g) \right)\\
	f_m = \frac{B_g^2}{(2)\mu_0}(2)(A_g)
\end{gathered}
$$

Since the cross sectional area of the gap in this case is $(2)(A_g)$ then the force per unit area of the air gap or *Magnetic Pressure* can be calculated as:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	F_m = \frac{B_g^2}{(2)\mu_0} \, N/m^2
\end{gathered}
$$

## Rotating Machines ##

![Rotator and Stator](/static/images/notes/RotatorStatorComponentsActuators.png)

The moving part in a rotating machine is called *Rotor* and the fixed part *Stator*. The rotor is mounted on a shaft between the ends of the stator. The simplest rotating machine would supply two independent paths, one to the rotor and one to the stator, using two independent coils, with the rotor coil using fixed brushes and rotor slip rings. Both currents are taken into account to calculate their corresponding stored field energy:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{ Static Equilibrium}\\
	dW_f = (e)(i_s) \,dt + (e)(i_r) \,dt\\
	dW_f = (i_s) \,d\lambda_s + (i_r) \,d\lambda_r
\end{gathered}
$$

As with linear systems we can use the coil inductance function $L(\theta)$ (this time in terms of the angle) to represent the rotor and stator linkage. This coil inductance function can be further subdivided into its self inductance ($L_{ss}(\theta)$ and $L_{rr}(\theta)$) and mutual inductance ($L_{ss}(\theta)$) components.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\lambda_s = L_{ss}(\theta)(i_s) + L_{sr}(\theta)(i_r)\\
	\lambda_r = L_{rs}(\theta)(i_s) + L_{rr}(\theta)(i_r)\\
	L_{sr} = L_{rs}\\
	dW_f = (i_s)d(L_{ss} i_s + L_{sr} i_r) + (i_r)d(L_{rs} i_s + L_{rr} i_r )\\
	dW_f = L_{ss} i_s  d(i_s) + L_{rr} i_r  d(i_r) + L_{sr} d(i_s i_r)\\
	W_f = L_{ss} \int_{0}^{i_s} (i_s)(di_s) + L_{rr} \int_{0}^{i_r} (i_r)(di_r) + L_{sr} \int_{0}^{i_s i_r} (di_s i_r)\\\\
	\text{Linear System Rotating Field Energy}\\
	W_f = W_f' = \frac{L_{ss} i_s^2 }{2} + \frac{L_{rr} i_r^2}{2} + L_{sr} i_s  i_r
\end{gathered}
$$

Just like the magnetic force we obtained from the stored field energy (with a constant current) we can also obtain the magnetic torque of the machine:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	T = \frac{dW_f'(i , \theta)}{d\theta}\\
	T = \frac{i_s^2}{2} \frac{d(L_{ss}(\theta))}{d\theta}  + \frac{i_r^2}{2} \frac{d(L_{rr}(\theta))}{d\theta} + i_s i_r \frac{d(L_{sr}(\theta))}{d\theta}
\end{gathered}
$$

Note that the first two terms of the last equation are the *Reluctance Torques* produced from the variation of the self inductance as a function of the rotor position (angle) while the last term is the *Mutual Inductance Torque* produced from the variation of their mutual inductance, also as a function of the rotor angle. Reluctance Torque can be produced naturally from the change in air gap length as the rotor rotates inside the stator.

# DC Machines # 

Just as a motor transforms from electrical into mechanical energy a generator transforms from mechanical energy into electrical energy. In both cases the intermediary or coupling field energy can be described in terms of the charges generated (Lorentz) or in terms of the conductors (Laplace).

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Lorentz's Law} \\
	f = (q)(E + v + B)\\
	\text{Laplace's Law} \\
	\vec{F} = (i)(\vec{l} \times \vec{B})
\end{gathered}
$$

In a generator we can find the induced voltage from the Lenz's Law that states $e = (B)(l)(v)$, where $v$ is the linear velocity of the conductor. From this equation and the Lorentz's Law we can conclude that the force generated by in the conductor is $f = (B)(l)(i)$, also known as Lorentz force. Note that in both cases the three vectors are mutually perpendicular. 

If the rotor or stator are subjected to a time variable magnetic field then the core is usually laminated to decrease energy losses due to parasitic Eddy Currents.

Armature windings and field windings

en la maquina dc el de campo nomramente esta en el estator y el de armadura en el rotor.

El voltaje siempre alterna por esta propiedad de los vectores.
Se utiliza n conmutador mecanico y un ensamble de escobillas como rectificador de este voltaje para volverlo unidireccional.

O TAMBIEN SE PUEDE UTILIZAR UN CIRCUITO RECTIFICADOR.


RECTIFICADOR 

LA combinacion de comnutador con escobilla se utiliza como rectificador para hacer que3 el voltaje en las terminales de la armadura sea unidireccional.
Este es mecanico pero tambien puede ser mediante un circuito.

Podemos reemplazar los anillos deslizantes por dos segmentos de conmutacion logrando que el voltaje en las escobillas sea unidireccional.


Una espira o vuelta conforma bobinas al conectarse en serie las cuales forman devanados al conectarse.
Las bobinas del devanado de armadura se pueden conectar mediante tipo lazo o tipo onda.

PARAQ OBTENER EL VOLTAJE INDUCIDO EN LA VUELTA O ESPIRA INDIVIDUAL

$$
\begin{gathered}
	e_t = (2)(B(\theta))(l)(\omega_m)(r)\\
	B(\theta) = \frac{\Phi}{A} = \frac{\Phi(p)}{(2)(\pi)(r)(l)}\\
	e_t = \frac{(\Phi)(p)(\omega_m)}{\pi}
\end{gathered}
$$

VOLTAJE PROIMEDIO EN LAS TERMINALES DEVIDO AL VOLTAJE INDUCIDO POR VUELTA O ESPIRA

$$
\begin{gathered}
	E_a = \frac{(N)(e_t)}{a} = \frac{(N)(p)(\Phi)(\omega_m)}{\pi (a)}\\
	E_a = (K_a)(\Phi)(\omega_m)
\end{gathered}
$$

En donde K es la constante de la maquina o armadura 

EN EL CASO DEL GENERADOR ES EL VOLTAJE INDUCIDO Y EN MOTOR ES LA FUERZA ELECTROMOTRIZ

LA FUERZA O TORQUE GENERADO EN LA ARMADURA SE PUEDE CALCULAR UTILIZANDO LA FUERZA DE Lorentz

Se calcula individualmente para cada vuelta y todos contribuyen al torque promedio y al torque total.
