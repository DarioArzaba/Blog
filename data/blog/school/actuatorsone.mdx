# Introduction #

Mechatronic System: Measures signals, processes them and generates an action through actuators. 

1. Structure: Body of the system, how we integrate components.
2. Sensors: Devices that detect physical magnitudes and transform them to electrical signals.
3. Actuators: Devices that perform actions in response to the signals.
4. Controllers: Regulate actuators response time and logic.
5. Interface: Devices that allow two or more systems to interact.

**Mechatronic System Components**

1. Actuators: Solenoid, DC Motor, Stepper Motor, Servomotor, Hydraulic, Pneumatic.
2. Sensors: Interrupter, Potentiometer, Photoelectric, Position Encoder, Calibration Device, Thermocouple, Accelerometer, MEM.
3. Input Signal Conditioning: Discrete Circuits, Amplifiers, Filters, Converters, Transformers.
4. Control Architectures: Logic Circuits, Microcontrollers, PLC, Control Algorithms.
5. Output Signal Conditioning: Amplifiers, Transistors, Op-Amps.
6. Interfaces: LED, Digital Screens, LCD, CRT.

**Control System**

![Control System Example](/static/images/notes/ControlSystemExample.png)

Interconnection of components in a configuration that gives you the desired response or *output signal* with respect to the reference *input signal* we have selected. Control systems allow us to detect a variable and then execute the actions needed to modify its value into the values we want. We can find control systems on most systems, for example in animals, machines or businesses. 

**Open Loop Control System**

![Open Loop System](/static/images/notes/OpenLoopControlSystem.png)

Here the output generated depends directly on the input, meaning that we don't compare the controlled output with the reference signal.

![Open Loop System Example](/static/images/notes/OpenLoopControlSystemExample.png)

For example a simple valve. Here the water flow is the input, the valve's position is the element of control, water level in the tank can be the element of correction, filling the tank is the process and maintaining the tank at a certain level is the controlled variable output.

**Closed Loop of Feedback Control System**

![Open Loop System](/static/images/notes/ClosedLoopControlSystem.png)

Here the output generated depends on the input and the corrections performed by the feedback signal, meaning that we compare the controlled output with the reference signal. 

The reference input is compared with the feedback signal from a sensor creating an error signal that the controller uses to act on the system via actuators, then the actuators change the output signal closer to the reference. The cycle repeats when the sensor takes another measurement.

![Open Loop System Example](/static/images/notes/ClosedLoopControlSystemExample.png)

For example, in a heating system the expected temperature is set in a thermostat as a reference or set point, a sensor measures the temperature in the room and compares it with the reference, their difference or error is then used by the controller to modify the valves of a gas furnace via actuators, this generates a feedback signal in the form of new heat that in turn changes the overall temperature (output signal). The cycle repeats as the sensor takes another measurement of the new output.

**Actuator**

A device that transforms energy to a desired motion or action, the control system *drives* the actuator by translating the controller's output into a usable signal.

**Actuator Classification**

1. Pneumatic: Transforms the energy of compressed air into to work like linear or circular motion. High power output from low applied force. 
2. Hydraulic: Transforms the energy of incompressible fluids, generally mineral oil, into work. Highest power output from low applied force. 
3. Electric: Transforms electrical energy into mechanical work. Lower torque but faster and more precise movements.

**Magnetic Field Concepts**

* Magnetic field $B$: Field that influences moving charges, electric currents and magnetic materials by inducing magnetic forces.
* Magnetic field intensity or strength $H$: Amount of magnetizing force in space. Measured in ampere per meter.
* Magnetic flux density $B$: Amount of magnetic force induced on a body due to a magnetizing force. Measured in tesla.
* Magnetic flux $\Phi$: Surface integral of the flux lines over a surface. Measured in weber.
* Magnetization $M$: Capability of a particular magnetic field strength to increase the magnetic flux density of a material.
* Magnetomotive Force $mmf$: Magnetic force that drives the motion of the magnetic flux through a body.

# Electromagnetic Actuators #


![Linear and Rotational Example](/static/images/notes/LinearandRotationalActuators.png)

Electromagnetic actuators an be classified into *Linear*, for example a solenoid valve, or *Rotational*, for example an electric motor. They are made from magnetic circuits with ferromagnetic or magnetic materials that shape and direct magnetic fields. The magnetic fields are used as a medium (electromagnetic energy) to convert from electrical energy into mechanical energy.

Permanent magnets and a layer of air in rotating machines help maintain the high flux needed to create a large torque. In most electrical machines (except permanent magnet machines) the magnetic flux is produced simply by driving a current through coils wound around a ferromagnetic core.

## Electromagnetic Relations ###

**i-H Relation**

![Relationship Magnetic Actuators](/static/images/notes/iHRelationActuators.png)

There is a direct relation between the current in a conductor and the magnetic field strength around it. First the direction of the flux lines can be determined by the *right hand rule*. The relation can be derived from *Ampere's Circuit Law*, stating that the line integral of the magnetic field $B$ around any closed path, when taking incremental steps $dl$, is equal to the total current $i$ linked by the contour times the medium's permeability $\mu_0$.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Ampere's Law}\\
	\oint \vec{B} \, \vec{dl} = (\mu_0)(i)\\\\
	\oint \vec{H} \, \vec{dl} \, \cos(\theta) = \sum i\\\\
	\text{Circle with one current}\\
	\oint H \, dl = i \implies H \oint dl = i\\
	(H)(2 \pi r) = i \implies H = \frac{i}{2 \pi r}
\end{gathered}
$$

By relating the magnetic field strength that surrounds a conductor to its current we can see that:

1. H will be the same at every point along the contour (magnetic field symmetry).
2. H is proportional to the current passing through the conductor.
2. H is inversely proportional to the radius of the contour.

**B-H Relation**

As H increases so does the magnetic flux density $B$. Permeability $\mu$ represents how easily the flux lines can pass through the medium before reaching its saturation point. In ferromagnetic materials such as iron, cobalt and nickel their relative permeability $mu_r$ varies from 100's to 1000's, for electric machines the value typically ranges from 2000 to 6000. We can see that:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	B = (\mu)(H) \, \text{T}\\
	\mu = (\mu_0)(\mu_r) \, \text{H/m}\\
	\mu_0 = 1.256637062 \times 10^{-6}
\end{gathered}
$$


1. A high $H$ will produce a high $B$ through the medium.
2. A high $\mu$ implies that a large $B$ will be obtained from a small current.

**Solenoid Field**

![Solenoid Field](/static/images/notes/SolenoidFieldActuators.png)

When we arrange a conductor into a coil we generate a uniform magnetic field, we call this arrangement a solenoid. As the solenoid increases in length we can see from its electromagnetic symmetry that the flux lines cancel each other out until the only lines remaining are the ones parallel to the solenoid's length. Every single horizontal line inside the solenoid gets amplified by the sum of the individual conductor loops flux lines therefore greatly increasing the overall flux density. 

![Ideal Solenoid Field](/static/images/notes/IdealSolenoidActuators.png)

If we consider an ideal solenoid (infinitely large) then the outside horizontal lines go in opposite directions canceling each other out, furthermore even if the solenoid isn't infinite the density of the outside flux lines is still negligible since their magnetic loop around the solenoid covers a far greater volume. Using an ideal solenoid and applying Ampere's Law to any contour, for example a rectangle where the current passes through gets us the solenoid field equations:

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\oint B \, dl = \int_a^b B \, dl + \int_b^c B \, dl + \int_c^d B \, dl + \int_d^a B \, dl\\
	\int_a^b B (0) = 0 \land  \int_c^d B \, (0) = 0\\
	\int_d^a B \, dl = 0 \text{ (ideal solenoid)}\\
	\oint B \, dl = \int_b^c B \, dl\\
	\text{Closed current in the rectangle}\\
	\sum i = i = (i_0)(n)(l)\\
	i_0 = \text{ Applied current}\\
	\text{Ampere's Circuit Law}\\
	\oint \vec{B} \, \vec{dl} = (\mu_0)(i)\\
	(B)(l) = (\mu_0)((i_0)(n)(l))\\
	\therefore B = (\mu_0)(i_0)(n)\\
	n = \text{ Turns per unit of length}
\end{gathered}
$$

This equation states that the flux density inside an ideal solenoid doesn't depend on the radius to the conductor or its overall length just on the current applied and the total number of turns per unit of length. We can see that:

1. To increase the $B$ in a solenoid we can increase the applied current or the number of turns by unit of length.

**Exercise**

A solenoid of length 0.6m has three layers of turns each with 500 turns. Calculate the magnetic field density inside the solenoid if we apply a 2A current.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	B = \mu_0 \frac{n i_0}{l} \\
	B = (1.25663 \times 10^{-6})\frac{(1500)(2)}{0.6} = 0.006283 \, \text{T}
\end{gathered}
$$

## Magnetic Equivalent Circuit ##

IMAGEN TOROIDE

We can make a simple magnetic circuit by putting a solenoid around a toroid core and just like before most of the flux density will be contained inside its core. This is almost the same case as the solenoid field equation with the only difference that the length will be the circumference of the toroid $l = 2\pi r$ .

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\oint \vec{H} \, \vec{dl} = (N)(i)\\
	H (2 \pi r) = H(l) = (N)(i) = F\\
	F = \text{ Magnetomotive Force mmf}\\
	\therefore H = \frac{(N)(i)}{l} \, \text{tA/m}\\
	B = (\mu)(H) \, \text{T}\\
	\therefore B = (\mu)\frac{(N)(i)}{l} \, \text{T}
\end{gathered}
$$

Note that since we are using a ferromagnetic core for the toroid $\mu$ will have a relative value. Now that we know the magnetic field intensity inside the toroid we can calculate how much flux is flowing $\Phi$ through a cross section.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\Phi = \int B \, dA\\
	\Phi = (B)(A) \, \text{wb}\\
	B = (\mu)\frac{(N)(i)}{l} \, \text{T}\\
	\Phi = (\mu)\frac{(N)(i)(A)}{l}\\
	\Phi = \frac{(N)(i)}{\frac{l}{(\mu)(A)}}\\
	\Phi = \frac{(N)(i)}{\Re}\\
	\Re = \frac{l}{(\mu)(A)} = \frac{1}{P}\\
	\Re = \text{ Magnetic Path Reluctance}\\
	P = \text{ Magnetic Path Permeance}
\end{gathered}
$$

IMAGEN CIRCUITO EQUIVALENTE

From this properties we can work with magnetic circuits using equivalent electrical circuits by equating the Magnetomotive Force $F$ to the Electromotive Force $E$ , the Flux flow $\Phi = \frac{F}{\Re}$ to the Current $i = \frac{E}{R}$ and the Magnetic Path Reluctance $\Re = \frac{l}{(\mu)(A)}$ to the Resistance $R = \frac{l}{(\sigma)(A)}$ .

The defining difference between an electrical circuit and a magnetomotive circuit is that power dissipation is associated with resistance but not with reluctance. An electrical field causes current to follow the path of least resistance, and a magnetic field causes magnetic flux to follow the path of least reluctance.


IMAGEN CURVAS MAGNETIZACION

The magnetization curve of a material represents how as we increase the magnetic intensity by driving a higher current the magnetic density also increases. The relation will remain linear for low intensity values but at high intensities it will reach a point of saturation. Note that the circuit's reluctance depends mostly on the density meaning that the higher the density the higher the reluctance. The magnetization curve will depend on the ferromagnetic core used, therefore in order to achieve the required level of flux density you might need different current values.

## Air Gap ##

IMAGEN DE LA MAQUINA ROTACIONAL CON AIR GAP

In rotating machines.The rotor is physically isolated from the stator by an air gap.

The same flux is present in the poles (magnetic core) and the ari gap, to mantain the same flux density the air gap requires much more F than the core. 

If the B is high the core of the circuit might exibit saturation, but the air gap will remain unsaturated since the magnetization curve of the air is linear (since mu is constant). 

For Analysis we can still use an equivalent magnetic circuit where we cave to distinct reluctances, one for the core and one for the air gap.

# Electric Machines #

## Magnetic Circuits ##

* Study of the devices used to transform between electrical and mechanical energy.
* The most common machines used are rotating machines like DC, induction or synchronous.
* Transformers aren't electromechanical converters but play an important role.
* Actuators, solenoids and releays are examples of linear motion machines.
* These devices use magnetic materials to direct the magnetic fields that act as an energy medium.
* These materials also generate a high magnetic field density (flux) translating into a large motion output.

**Magnetic Circuits**

Formed by ferromagnetic materials only (transformers) or ferromagnetic materials with an air gap (rotating machines). The magnetic field (flux) is produced by an electrical current passing through coils wound on the ferromagnetic material, except on permanent magnet machines.

**i-H Relation**

There is a relation between the current in a coil and the magnetic field intensity (flux or H) it produces.

The *direction* of the flux lines can be determined by the thumb rule, meaning that if the current (i) travels in the direction of the thumb then the flux lines follow the direction of the rest of the fingers.

This relation can be obtained using *Amphere's circuit law*. This law states that the line integral of $H$ arround a closed path is equal to the total current in the contour. 

Here $H$ is the magnetic field intensity at a countour point, $dl$ is the incremental length at that point. Notice that there *could* be an angle between the vectors $H$ and $dl$ called $\theta$.

Assuming the current travels through an ideal conductor we can simplify the countour to a circle meaning that we can obtain $H$ at a distance $r$ from the conductor. Here there is no $\theta$ since $H$ and $dl$ follow the same direction.
