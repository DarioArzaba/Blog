# Introduction #

* Mechatronic System: Measures signals, process them and generates an action through actuators or motion. 
	* Structure: Body of the system, how we integrate the components.
	* Sensors: Devices that detect physical magnitudes and transform them to electrical signals.
	* Actuators: Devices that perform actions in response to the signals.
	* Controllers: Regulate actuators response time and logic.
	* Interface: Devices that allow two or more systems to interact.

**Control System**

Interconnection of components in a configuration that gives the desire response or *output signal* with respect to the reference *input signal* we have selected. In the most abstract sense control systems allow us to detect a variable and execute the actions needed to modify its value to the values we want. We can find control systems in most systems, for example in animals, machines or businesses. 

![Control System Example](/static/images/notes/ControlSystemExample.png)

**Open Loop Control System**

Here the output genereted depends directly on the input, meaning that we don't compare the controlled output with the reference signal. 

There is an expected signal input, an element of control, an element of correction, a process and a controlled variable output.

![Open Loop System](/static/images/notes/OpenLoopControlSystem.png)

For example a manual valve. Here the expected water flow is the input, the valve position is the element of control, the water level in a tank can be the element of correction, the process is the water filling the tank and finally the controlled variable output is mantaining the tank full of water.

Notice that in this example the actuator is the person turning the valve.

**Closed Loop of Feedback Control System**

Here the output generated depends on the input and the corrections performed by the feedback signal, meaning that we compare the controlled output with the reference signal.

There is a reference input signal that is compared with the feedback signal or output measurement of a sensor, from this comparison comes an error signal that the controller uses to act on the system via actuators, the actuators change the output signal closer to the reference signal. The cycle repeats when the sensor takes another measurement of the output.

![Open Loop System](/static/images/notes/ClosedLoopControlSystem.png)

For example a heating system. Here the expected temperature is set as a reference or set point in the thermostat, a sensor compares this reference with the measured temperature of the house, the difference or error signal is used by controller to modify the valves of a gas furnace via actuators, this generates a feedback signal in the form of new heat that in turn changes the overall temperature or output signal. The cycle repeats as the sensor takes another measurement of the new output.

Notice that in this example the actuator are motors that turn the valves.

**Actuator**

Device that transforms energy to a desired motion or action. The *Driving System* of an actuator are the elements in the control system that translate the controller output to a usable signal by the actuator.

**Mechanic System Components**

1. Actuators: Solenoids, DC Motors, Stepped Motors, Servomotors, Hydraulic, Pneumatic.
2. Sensors: Interrupters, Potentiometers, Photoelectric, Digital Position Encoder, Calibration Device, Thermocouple, Accelerometer, MEM
3. Input Signal Conditioning: Discrete Circuits, Amplifiers, Filters, Converters and Transformers
4. Control Architectures: Logic Circuits, Microcontrollers, PLC, Control Algorithms
5. Output Signal Conditioning: Amplifiers, Transistors, Op-Amps
6. Interfaces: LED, Digital Screens, LCD, CRT

Examples of mechanic systems that use actuators are robotic arms, car wippers, automatic transmissions or car valve bodies.

**Classification**

1. Hydraulic: Transform the energy of compressed air to mechanic work such as linear or circular motion.
2. Pneumatic: Transform the energy of fluid pressure (generally mineral fluid) to mechanic work. Their advantage is that a lot of power can be obtained from little applied force.
3. Electric: Transform electrical energy to mechanic work such as linear or circular motion.

## Magnetic Circuits ##

* Study of the devices used to transform between electrical and mechanical energy.
* The most common machines used are rotating machines like DC, induction or synchronous.
* Transformers aren't electromechanical converters but play an important role.
* Actuators, solenoids and releays are examples of linear motion machines.
* These devices use magnetic materials to direct the magnetic fields that act as an energy medium.
* These materials also generate a high magnetic field density (flux) translating into a large motion output.

**Magnetic Circuits**

Formed by ferromagnetic materials only (transformers) or ferromagnetic materials with an air gap (rotating machines). The magnetic field (flux) is produced by an electrical current passing through coils wound on the ferromagnetic material, except on permanent magnet machines.

**i-H Relation**

There is a relation between the current in a coil and the magnetic field intensity (flux or H) it produces.

The *direction* of the flux lines can be determined by the thumb rule, meaning that if the current (i) travels in the direction of the thumb then the flux lines follow the direction of the rest of the fingers.

This relation can be obtained using *Amphere's circuit law*. This law states that the line integral of $H$ arround a closed path is equal to the total current in the contour. 



Here $H$ is the magnetic field intensity at a countour point, $dl$ is the incremental length at that point. Notice that there *could* be an angle between the vectors $H$ and $dl$ called $\theta$.

Assuming the current travels through an ideal conductor we can simplify the countour to a circle meaning that we can obtain $H$ at a distance $r$ from the conductor. Here there is no $\theta$ since $H$ and $dl$ follow the same direction.

## Magnetic Circuits and Materials ##

* Devices used in the conversion of electrical and mechanical energy.
* In general the conversion is done with electromagnetic rotating machines.
* The transformer isn't a conversion device but is also an important component.
* Ferro Magnetic materials are the most common way of shaping and directing the magnetic fields.
* Permanent Magnet materials are also used.

**Magnetic Circuits**

* To analyse magnetic fields we simplify the system solving Maxwell's equations.
* We assume that the frequency and size of the system are such that the *displacement-current* term in Maxwell's equations can be neglected.
* The *displacement-current* term is used in magnetic fields produced by time-varying electric fields usually from electromagnetic radiation.
* This simplification results in the *magneto-quasistatic* form of the Maxwell's equations, this form relates the current in the system to the magnetic field it produces.
