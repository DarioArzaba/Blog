# Introduction

**CAD**

Technical drawing or drafting is the creation of drawings to visually communicate the function or construction of a machine through a series of standard views, symbols, units, measurements, styles, and locations on paper. It is used in mechanical, industrial and construction applications.

CAD is called computer-aided design, it is all software that produces technical drawings using 2D or 3D models. They can generate technical drawings in a Parametric or Non-Parametric way (Surfacing).

**Parametric CAD**

Allows you to create models using mathematical values ​​in space, creating a history of the operations performed. Used in mechanical design for its flexibility and precision.

* NX
* Cathia
* AutoCAD
* Inventor
* Solidworks

**Nonparametric CAD** 

Allows you to create models by surfacing or styling surfaces. Generally through nurbs allowing to create Flow Surfaces (Class A).

* Alias
* Rhinoceros
* Evolve

# NX

NX is a parametric CAD developed by Siemens PLM Software.

* Initial Interface: Menus Tab, Ribbon Bar, Resource Bar, Graphic Area, Guide Bar
* Template: File Type and File Name / Route
* Zoom and Pan: View Tab, Graphic Tab
* Part Navigator: Features History, Features Dependencies, Right Click Functions Tab
* WCS: Work Coordinate System. View Triad Reference to Absolute WCS
* Part Navigator: True Shading, S. Edges, Shaded, Wireframe, W. Hidden, W. Dim Edges.
* Orientation: Left, Right, Top, Front, Side, Back.
* Datum: Vector Reference to Object Geometry
* Grid: Automotive default of 100 mm.
* Tool box: Required Input and Value input.
* Class Selection Filter and Object Display Ctrl + J.

## First Practice:

1. Open file 01_B.prt
2. Identify the View Traid (Click “w”)
3. Identify the Resource Bar
4. Identify the Part Navigator
5. Identify the Parent dependencies & child dependencies
6. Visaulize the part in different styles
7. Identify the WCS
8. Fit, Zoom, Pan & Rotate
9. Close the part

## Second Practice:

1. Open file 02_B.prt
2. Identify the Work Layer
3. Delete the Edge Blend (7), (8) & (9)
4. Close the file

**Views and Primitives**

The orthogonal projection can be American (ASA) or European (ISO). The orthographic projection turns the object into 2D. The perspectives can be isometric or trimetric. Primitive geometries are basic three-dimensional figures. Boolean operations allow two or more primitives to interact with each other through unions, subtractions, or intersections.

## Third Practice:

1. Create models with boolean operations and primitives.
2. Paste screeshots of the basic views.

**NX Apps**

The Modeling application is used to create the geometry of parts. To modify the Layout we use User Roles. To join the parts we use Assemblies. PMI (Product and Manufacturing Information) allows you to annotate geometry in 3D. Drafting is the application that generates the 2D documentation. Manufacturing allows you to create NC (Numerical Control) Paths used to create the molds. Finally the Design Simulation is used to analyze the application of forces.
