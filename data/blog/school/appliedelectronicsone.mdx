# Operational Amplifier #

![Simple Op-Amp](/static/images/notes/LM741AppliedElectro.png)

Op-Amps are high gain, direct current, coupled electronic amplifier devices with two inputs and one output, in other words they are a voltage dependent voltage source. The first monolithic op-amp was created in 1964 at the Fairchild Semiconductor Company by Robert John Widlar model Î¼A702. Despite living in a digital world Op-Amps are still widely used in engineering when working with analog signals.

Op-Amps are bipolar in nature since they can be supplied with a negative (VEE Emitter or VDD Drain) or positive (VCC Collector or VSS Source) voltage sources. This working voltages produce a negative (Ic-) and positive (Ic+) currents respectively. Note that VEE and VCC apply to BJT transistor based Op-Amps while VCC and VSS apply to FET transistor based Op-Amps.

Aside from its voltage sources the Op-Amp uses a Non Inverting (Vp) and Inverting (Vn) input voltages as signals used to determine its output voltage (Vo) value. The range of voltages an Op-Amp can supply is given by its voltage sources. Kirchhoff's Current Law shows that every current that enters and exits the Op-Amp must equal cero: $i_n + i_p + i_{c+} + i_{c-} + i_o = 0$

$$
\begin{gathered}
	V_i = V_p - V_n = \text{ Differential Voltage}\\
	R_i = \text{ Input Resistance}\\
	R_o = \text{ Output Resistance}\\
	A = \text{ Open Loop Gain} = 200000 \frac{V_o}{V_i}\text{ (LM741)}
\end{gathered}
$$

As mentioned before the differential voltage (Vi) is used to determined the output voltage (Vo) of the internal dependent voltage source that is composed of transistors. The factor by which the differential voltage relates to the output voltage is called open loop gain (A).

The *Op-Amp Curve* represents the differential-output voltage relation and the range in which this relation remains linear, outside of this region (limited by the voltage sources) the differential voltage will have little effect over the output voltage (saturation).

The ideal Op-Amp is a model where we assume the following:

| Value | Ideal Model | Real Op-Amp |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Input Impedance $R_i$ | Infinite (No current from signals) | $10^6 \land 10^12$ Ohms |
| Output Impedance $R_o$ | 0 (No voltage loss at output) | $>100$ Ohms | 
| Open Loop Gain $A$ | Infinite (Perfectly Linear) | $\approx 200000$ (Depends on signal bandwidth) |
| Offset | 0 | Millivolts to Nanovolts (Offset at output when signals are grounded) |
| Bias Currents $i_p$ and $i_n$ | 0 | Microamperes to Nanoamperes (Current from signals) |
| Bias Voltage (Supply) | Any Value | Generally $\pm 18 V$ |

NOTE: A hook ammeter is used to measure current without opening the circuit. Another way is by using a shunt resistor.

![Negative Feedback](/static/images/notes/ExampleIdealInvertingOpAmpAppliedElectro.png)

An Op Amp can be a simple control system by when part of the output voltage is used as feedback and then substracted of the inverter input signal. This is an example of a simple Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) control system. The feedback signal adds another gain to the system, called the closed loop gain G.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Closed Loop Gain}\\
	G = \frac{V_o}{V_i} \implies (V_i)(G) = V_o\\
	G = \frac{A}{1+\beta A}\\
	\text{Ideal Closed Loop Gain}\\
	A = \infty \implies G = \frac{1}{\beta}
\end{gathered}
$$

![Inverting Circuit](/static/images/notes/SolvingBySuperpositionInvertingOpAppliedElectro.png)


The following is the negative feedback configuration for an inverter, we assume the same conditions of an ideal open loop Op-Amp with the crucial difference that in this case we assume that there is a finite value for the open loop gain A.

$$
\begin{gathered}
	\text{Without Source}\\
	V_{no} = \frac{(V_o)(R_1)}{(R_1) + (R_2)}\\
	\text{With Source}\\
	V_{nin} = \frac{(V_{in})(R_2)}{(R_1) + (R_2)}\\
	\text{Inverting Closed Loop Gain}\\
	V_n = V_{no} + V_{nin} = \frac{(V_o)(R_1)}{(R_1) + (R_2)} + \frac{(V_{in})(R_2)}{(R_1) + (R_2)}\\
	V_o = A(V_p - V_n) \land V_p = 0 \implies V_n = \frac{-V_o}{A}\\
	\frac{-V_o}{A} = \frac{(V_o)(R_1)}{(R_1) + (R_2)} + \frac{(V_{in})(R_2)}{(R_1) + (R_2)}\\
	G = \frac{V_o}{V_{in}} = \frac{-A}{1+\frac{R_1}{R_2}(1+A)}= \frac{-R_2}{R_1}\\
	\therefore G = \frac{-R_2}{R_1}
\end{gathered}
