 Contextualization
What is an Operational Amplifier (Op Amp)?
An operational amplifier, often known as an op-amp (operational amplifier), is a high-gain, direct-current-coupled electronic amplifier device that has two inputs and one output. In this configuration, the output of the device is generally hundreds of thousands of times greater than the potential difference between its inputs, hence the word "Amplifier". While "Operational" is because its use is very varied for the electronic manipulation of analog signals, both direct current and alternating current. One such device is based on transistors and packaged in a high-scale integration circuit.

Its schematic symbol is a horizontal triangle in which the input terminals go at the base of the triangle and the output at the vertex opposite said base, as shown in the following figures.

Sometimes in schematic diagrams the power terminals of the devices are indicated. In the case of an OpAmp, such as one of the previous figures, it normally has a positive voltage supply terminal (+ Vcc) and a negative voltage supply terminal (-Vcc).

The first operational amplifiers (op-amps) were used primarily to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, integration, and differentiation, hence the term operational. These early devices were built with vacuum tubes and operated at high voltages. Today's operational amplifiers are linear integrated circuits (ICs) that use relatively low dc supply voltages, are reliable, inexpensive, and most importantly - allow you to manipulate analog signals.

Brief history of Op Amps
The concept of the operational amplifier emerged around 1947, as a device built with vacuum tubes, as part of the first analog computers within which mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, integration, derivation, etc.) were carried out, from which the name by which it is known originated.

The first monolithic operational amplifier built as an integrated circuit, it was developed in 1964 at the Fairchild Semiconductor Company by American electrical engineer Robert John Widlar and carried the model number μA702.

This was followed by the μA709 (1965), also from Widlar, which was a great commercial success. Later it would be replaced by the popular μA741 (1968), developed by David Fullagar, and manufactured by numerous companies, based on bipolar technology, which became a standard in the electronics industry, which despite time, remains a very popular device. still used today.



Despite their time in the electronics industry and the current domain of digital electronics, OpAmps are still widely used, as they are the main electronic device that allows electronic systems to handle analog electrical signals, this is very important because, To happen that we live in a "digital world", the phenomena that we need to measure and control are analog, that's where OpAmp comes in.
