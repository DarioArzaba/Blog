This is an overview of the knowledge needed for designing electronic solutions using analog circuits and operational amplifiers. Understand analog circuits that handle linear and non-linear amplification systems, also learn the integration of converters in this systems. Requires knowledge in semiconductors, diodes and transistors.

**Project Description**

* Investment company in technology products asking for a new electronic product that solves the problem of a community. 
* The electronic system must be based on Op-Amps and converters, it must be innovative, feasible, and with a high possibility of becoming a venture. 
* In the design stage you must quantitatively demonstrate the need to be solved, addressing constraints, costs, competition etc. 
* Possible areas are health, education, entertainment, safety, productivity, quality of life, environment.
* The electrical supply will be a 110VAC or a DC Battery, energy consumption of the circuit must be included. 
* Final proposal must include a technical report with the objective, functionality to be improved, evidence of the need, block diagrams, schematics, specifications, components, costs (acquisition, integration, manufacture), prototype and documentary video of the design process (less than 5 minutes). An oral presentation and defense of your product in 10 minutes will be evaluated by outside experts.

There will be 4 PDF deliverables of a maximum of 4 pages (single spacing and 11 point font), they won't be graded but will help you reach the final proposal in time.

* Deliverable 1: Problem definition. Description of the problem, need or value. Problems that justify the product. Target population, who experiences this problem. Describe the context of the project, why it needs an engineering solution. Identify restrictions and requirements.
* Deliverable 2: Summary of the project. Basic purpose of the project. Geographic area and population that will benefit. Similar products, competition, maybe designed for a different population. Expected results. How it will change the live of individuals, communities or the world.
* Deliverable 3: Requirements and restrictions. Restrictions placed on the system. Risk factors that threaten the project.
* Deliverable 4: Design team. Name of the team, who are its members and what roles they will play.
